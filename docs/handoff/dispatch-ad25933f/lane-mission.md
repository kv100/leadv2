Product implementation task dispatch-ad25933f. Implement this mechanism-closed design; preserve its non-goals. Before closing, run the required end-to-end gate and the cross-provider review gate recorded for this task.

PREPASS-MECHANISM-CLOSURE-01 — the design is authoritative, but it is not infallible, and you are the one reading the actual code. If discovery FALSIFIES its census — a caller it did not list, a return code whose consequence differs from what it claims, a configuration state it missed — STOP and say so in your report instead of implementing around it. Silently implementing a design whose census is wrong is how a defect becomes the next review round. Correcting the census in your report is a valid, valuable deliverable; quietly widening scope beyond it is not.

---
If you hit a decision you cannot safely make yourself (including destructive
options, a policy conflict, or missing authorization), ask via the async
question channel and wait for the answer rather than guessing or stalling:
  bash "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/../../scripts/leadv2-ask.sh" "dispatch-ad25933f" "<question>" \
    --option "a|<reversible label>" --option "b|<label>" --default-option "a" [--timeout <sec=1800>]
It blocks until answered via `/leadv2 reply <q-id> <option>` and prints the
chosen option. Every question must declare its clearly reversible option with
`--default-option`; on timeout the lane proceeds on it and the decision is
journaled and surfaced in open-threads. Without a default, the task is parked
human-needed and its slot is freed. Do not use this for routine progress or
confirmation-seeking; only for a decision you cannot make yourself.

Before you finish, run your own falsification set and paste its raw output into
your final report: `bash -n` every shell file you changed, `python3 -m
py_compile` every Python file you changed, and the repo's changed-scope test
runner. Show the red output you got and the green output after your fix. A lane
whose self-check is missing or red is refused before any reviewer is spent on
it -- you will have burned the lane for nothing.

Commit your work on the lane branch before ending your session; an uncommitted
exit is treated as an incident.
