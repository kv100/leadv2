#
# Fires on the same "chore: close TASK-ID"-style git commit that
# leadv2-close-ritual-guard.sh gates. If the staged diff appears to
# introduce new domain vocabulary (new class/def/interface/table
# definitions or new ALL-CAPS/CamelCase glossary-shaped terms) and the
# repo has a CONTEXT.md, print a reminder to run the `domain-modeling`
# skill to update it. ADVISORY ONLY — never blocks the commit.
#
# Modeled on leadv2-close-ritual-guard.sh (close-commit detection) and
# leadv2-one-copy-drift.sh's post-sync warning leg (warn-only, always exit 0).
#
# lean: vocab-detection is a coarse grep heuristic (new class/def/
# interface/CREATE TABLE lines in the staged diff), not a real NLP/glossary
# diff — upgrade when domain-modeling exposes a `--check-diff` mode that
# can compare against CONTEXT.md's existing glossary terms directly.
