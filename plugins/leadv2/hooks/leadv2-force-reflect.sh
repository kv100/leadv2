# Stop hook: force Phase 8 close (which contains lead-reflect) when a task reached
# substantive completion (verify/deploy) but the lead is ending the session without closing.
#
# WHY: lead-reflect is Step 2 of the leadv2-close skill — prose the lead routinely skips,
# so the self-learning loop never starts (synthesis-log empty all-time, 2026-05-29 diagnosis).
# The clean "closed" signal (phase8-passed.flag) is written by leadv2-phase8-assert.sh ONLY
# AFTER reflect (assert A4 requires the "<task_id> ✅" history line) — useless for forcing
# reflect. So we trigger on the authoritative phase state from docs/leadv2/active.yaml.
#
# PHASE SIGNAL (active.yaml) — replaces the old mtime/artifact-glob approach:
#   Fire ONLY when a session's `phase` field is one of: deploy, verify, live_verify, close.
#   These map to the real phase strings written by leadv2_active_update_phase:
#     - deploy      -> after Phase 5 REVIEW passes   (leadv2-review/SKILL.md)
#     - verify      -> after Phase 6 DEPLOY completes (leadv2-deploy/SKILL.md)
#     - close       -> after Phase 7 LIVE VERIFY      (leadv2-verify/SKILL.md)
#     - live_verify -> alias used by some older tasks
#   Do NOT fire for: intake, classify, plan, build, review -- task not yet substantively complete.
#
# WHY MTIME WAS WRONG:
#   `git worktree` checkout resets every file's mtime to the current time. An unrelated stale
#   task's verify.md would look fresh (age < 30 min) after any worktree operation, causing this
#   hook to block early phases (Plan/Build) of a DIFFERENT active task. The mtime signal had
#   no binding to the current session's active task whatsoever.
#
# Bounded to ONE forced block per task (.reflect-forced marker), never loops
# (honours stop_hook_active), reads active.yaml for authoritative phase state.
