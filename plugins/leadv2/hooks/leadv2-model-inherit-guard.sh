# PreToolUse(Agent) model guard (founder directive 2026-06-09, updated 2026-06-18).
#
# PRINCIPLE: expensive model (opus) ONLY for high-judgment agents; cheap operations
# must never get opus — not by inheritance, not by explicit request.
#
# OPUS ALLOWLIST — subagent_types allowed to spawn with an opus model:
#   architect, critic, security-auditor,
#   leadv2:architect, leadv2:critic, leadv2:security-auditor
# All other subagent_types that request opus are DENIED with an actionable message.
#
# For non-opus models: explicit model= always passes (as before).
# For no explicit model= at all: falls through to the inheritance-guard logic below.
#
# Inheritance guard guarantees: even when the MAIN chat is Opus, no subagent silently
# inherits Opus. A subagent's model is Opus-by-inheritance ONLY when BOTH are true:
#   (1) the Agent call passes no explicit model=, AND
#   (2) the agent definition has no frontmatter `model:` to pin it.
# This hook DENIES exactly that case (forcing an explicit model= or a frontmatter fix),
# and passes everything else silently. Custom agents that pin model: sonnet/haiku are safe.
# Was WARN-only until 2026-06-09; warn proved insufficient (Opus quota leak via inherited spawns).
