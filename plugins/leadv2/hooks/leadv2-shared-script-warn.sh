# leadv2-shared-script-warn.sh — PreToolUse:Edit|Write|MultiEdit warn-only hook.
#
# PLUGIN-DISTRIBUTION-SILENT-EDIT-HAZARD-01 (2026-07-28): Stage 3 converted
# ~170-215 vendored .claude/scripts/*.sh|py|mjs per repo into PER-FILE
# SYMLINKS pointing at the single canonical tree
# (~/Projects/leadv2/plugins/leadv2/scripts/<name>), identical across
# persona-engine, m3-market, and respiro-ios (live-verified by marker-append/
# revert test, see persona-engine docs/handoff/supervisor-scope/
# plugin-propagation-process.md). Editing "this repo's copy" of one of these
# files now silently rewrites the one real file that all three repos run --
# with ZERO warning anywhere: leadv2-lead-edit-guard.sh:68 explicitly
# EXEMPTS `.claude/scripts/leadv2-*.sh` from its own warning (an exemption
# written when these were per-repo copies -- now exactly backwards), and
# leadv2-one-copy-drift.sh (PostToolUse:Bash leg, merged from the retired
# leadv2-plugin-sync-drift-warn.sh) only fires after a Bash command that
# invokes leadv2-plugin-sync.sh itself, never on an ordinary Edit/Write.
#
# This hook closes that gap. It is UNCONDITIONAL (no LEADV2_LEAD_GUARD gate --
# that guard is lead-only and opt-in; this risk applies to every editor,
# lead or subagent) and WARN-ONLY (continueOnBlock: true in hooks.json,
# and this script itself always exits 0). It never blocks: the founder
# edits these files deliberately and often, and blocking would make
# ordinary plugin work painful. It only fires when the edited path is
# ACTUALLY a symlink resolving outside the repo it's edited from --
# a repo-native (real, non-symlinked) file in the same directory stays
# silent.
#
# Consumer-repo list comes from cross-repo-paths.yaml (the same file
# leadv2-crossrepo-aggregate.sh treats as authoritative) so this stays
# correct if a repo is added or removed later, rather than hardcoding names
# that would drift.
