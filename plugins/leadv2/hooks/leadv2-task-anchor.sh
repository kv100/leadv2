# leadv2-task-anchor.sh — UserPromptSubmit hook (LEAD-ANCHOR-01).
#
# Problem this fixes: nothing re-anchored the lead on the ACTIVE /leadv2 task
# when a new founder message arrived — the newest message silently won, the
# task was abandoned mid-flight, and the lead narrated instead of continuing
# the plan. Spec: docs/handoff/LEAD-ANCHOR-01/mission.md (persona-engine repo).
#
# Detection:
#   1. docs/leadv2/active.yaml has a live (non-stale) session whose worktree
#      matches this invocation's cwd, OR
#   2. a STATE.md (docs/leadv2/tasks/<id>/STATE.md — canonical per
#      leadv2-phase8-assert.sh; docs/handoff/<id>/STATE.md checked too for
#      forward-compat) modified in the last 12h with no sibling
#      docs/handoff/<id>/phase8-passed.flag (the real close sentinel path,
#      per leadv2-phase8-assert.sh).
#   No active task -> THREAD anchor fallback (round 2, LEAD-ANCHOR-01 r2):
#   if docs/leadv2/open-threads.md and/or scheduled-decisions.md exist, print
#   a reworded <task-anchor> block instead of staying silent. Only truly
#   empty state (neither file present) emits nothing.
#
# Output: a <task-anchor> block, hard-capped at 40 lines, ending with the
# fixed DIRECTIVE text verbatim (task mode) or the reworded THREAD DIRECTIVE
# (thread-fallback mode).
#
# Round 2 also adds auto-capture: any incoming prompt that looks like a new
# ask (>=20 chars, not a bare answer) is appended, deduped, to
# docs/leadv2/open-threads.md under "## Captured asks (auto)" (cap 40
# entries). Capture is best-effort and NEVER affects hook exit/stdout.
#
# OPEN-THREADS-HYGIENE-01: an entry is removed the moment it's resolved
# (scripts/leadv2-thread-prune.sh resolve <substring>) — there is no
# intermediate "- [x] " state to reaccumulate. capture_ask() also strips any
# "- [x] " line on every write, defensively, in case one is added some other
# way (e.g. a human hand-checking a box in an editor).
#
# Fail-open: ANY error -> exit 0 with empty stdout. Never blocks a prompt.
# stdlib-only (bash + python3, +PyYAML if present — degrades gracefully
# without it), zero network. Target <300ms.
