# glm-coder.sh v2 — headless GLM-5.3 code-worker wrapper + background workbench
# Live acceptance evidence: plugins/leadv2/docs/evidence/glm-5.3-probe.md.
# (Z.AI Coding Plan, Anthropic-compatible endpoint).
#
# v1 surface (unchanged): `run` blocks until GLM finishes (v1 exit code, out-file
# path); `test` self-test. New v2 workbench: `bg` detaches immediately and runs
# under ~/.claude/cache/glm-runs/<run-id>/ with a single-flight per-repo lock,
# stream-json journal, best-effort progress parser, and a process-group timeout
# watchdog. `status`/`tail`/`watch`/`list` mirror codex-task.sh UX.
#
# GLM-ROUTING-V2-01 (design.md Part 2 + Codex review resolutions R1-R5).
#
# GLM-RELIABILITY-529-01 (2026-07-08, fix-round-4 RADICAL SIMPLIFY): the
# `claude` CLI's own Anthropic-SDK HTTP client retries provider-overload
# (HTTP 529/503/429) up to `max_retries: 300` with exponential backoff,
# emitting `{"type":"system","subtype":"api_retry",...}` events into the
# stream-json journal but NOTHING into progress.log -- so a sustained-529 run
# sat silent for up to ~1h (the old GLM_TIMEOUT), indistinguishable from
# "still working". Three prior fix rounds tried increasingly careful
# per-poll overload-detection heuristics (streak/grace, then progress-based,
# then unresolved-window-scoped) -- each review round caught a new subtle
# race in the same fundamentally fragile shape. Founder decision: RIP OUT
# the whole detection primitive; rely on the existing GLM_TIMEOUT watchdog as
# the single bound, now lowered to 900s.
#
# NET BEHAVIOR: sustained overload -> SDK retries happen inside the `claude`
# binary -> each is logged as a `PROVIDER_RETRY status=<n> attempt=<n>` line
# in progress.log (visible, not silent) -> the run is bounded by the 900s
# GLM_TIMEOUT -> the existing timeout watchdog touches `.timed_out` FIRST,
# before TERM/KILL -> two-sentinel contract emits `GLM_FALLBACK_TO_SONNET` +
# exit 76. No 1-hour hang (900s worst case). Zero race-prone detection logic.
# `cmd_bg` still returns immediately; callers still grep progress.log
# sentinels + meta.yaml exit_code.
#
# Two-sentinel contract on run end (mutually exclusive), written to
# progress.log + meta.yaml's exit_code field:
#   - GLM_FALLBACK_TO_SONNET / exit GLM_FALLBACK_EXIT_CODE (76): `.timed_out`
#     fired, OR the run produced no coherent/parseable result at all
#     (garbage/unparsable output, or an ERROR terminal result -- FIX2) --
#     a provider/infra problem or ambiguity either way, fail-safe treats it
#     as "try sonnet". The real/diagnostic exit code is still logged via
#     RUN_FAILED for debugging.
#   - GLM_PERMANENT_FAILURE: the child ran to completion with a COHERENT,
#     NON-error result but a genuine non-zero exit and NO timeout marker --
#     a real task failure, not a provider problem; sonnet would hit the same
#     wall. meta.yaml exit_code PRESERVES the real child exit code (never
#     overridden). A genuine exit-0 + coherent non-error result is
#     unconditionally SUCCESS regardless of a stale marker (FIX3, explicit
#     precedence).
# glm-coder.sh does NOT invoke sonnet itself -- it only signals; the
# caller/Monitor decides what to do with each sentinel.
#
# GLM_CLAUDE_BIN/GLM_RUNS_DIR/GLM_SECRETS_FILE are test seams (default to the
# exact prior hardcoded values) so tests can stub the `claude` binary and
# isolate run/lock state without touching prod.

Usage:
  glm-coder.sh run "<prompt|@file>" [--out <file>] [--cwd <dir>]
  glm-coder.sh bg  "<prompt|@file>" [--cwd <dir>] [--max-turns N] [--timeout S]
  glm-coder.sh status [run-id]
  glm-coder.sh tail <run-id>
  glm-coder.sh watch <run-id>
  glm-coder.sh list [N]
  glm-coder.sh test

  run     v1-compat: blocks until GLM finishes. Prints only the out-file path
          and the v1 exit code.
  bg      Detaches immediately, prints a run-id. Work continues under
          ~/.claude/cache/glm-runs/<run-id>/ (journal.jsonl, progress.log,
          result.md, meta.yaml). One run per repo (cwd) at a time — a second
          concurrent `bg` for the same repo exits 75 (lock busy).
  status  Prints meta.yaml for <run-id> (latest run if omitted).
  tail    Last 20 progress.log lines + result.md head.
  watch   `tail -f` on progress.log (live).
  list    Last N runs: id, status, repo, started_at. Default N=10.
  test    Self-test: sends a short prompt and prints the tail of the response.

Env knobs: GLM_TIMEOUT (default 3600s), GLM_MAX_TURNS (default 120),
  GLM_TURN_LIMIT (default 120), GLM_STALL_S (default 1200s, diagnostic only),
  GLM_NO_PROGRESS_S (default 1800s),
  GLM_FALLBACK_EXIT_CODE (default 76).

Terminal sentinels (GLM-RELIABILITY-529-01) — mutually exclusive, appended to
progress.log, mirrored into meta.yaml's exit_code field:
  GLM_FALLBACK_TO_SONNET   `.timed_out` fired, OR no coherent/non-error
                           result at all (garbage/unparsable output, or an
                           error terminal result) — ambiguous either way,
                           fail-safe treats it as "try sonnet". meta.yaml
                           exit_code = GLM_FALLBACK_EXIT_CODE (76).
  GLM_PERMANENT_FAILURE    Coherent, non-error result but a genuine non-zero
                           exit, no timeout marker: a real task failure
                           sonnet would hit too. meta.yaml exit_code = the
                           REAL child exit code (never overridden).
Provider retries (HTTP 429/503/529) are logged as PROVIDER_RETRY lines in
progress.log for visibility. Wall time, observed turns, and no-progress time
all terminate through the same timeout marker and fallback path.
glm-coder.sh never invokes sonnet itself — callers/Monitor must react to
whichever sentinel appears.

# macOS ships no util-linux setsid; python3 os.setsid()+execvp is the portable
# equivalent, used to give a subtree its own process group (R4).
#
# MUST be `exec`'d as the function's last command: without `exec`, backgrounding
# a call to this function (`setsid_wrapper ... &`) forks a wrapper subshell whose
# pid ($!) is what callers capture, while python3 (and the setsid'd process it
# execs into) is a further child ONE pid deeper with a DIFFERENT pgid. That
# mismatch silently breaks watchdog_loop's `kill -TERM -$child_pid` (targets a
# nonexistent process group, no-ops) — live-verified via the process tree during
# build (2026-07-03). `exec` replaces the wrapper subshell's own image, so the
# pid callers capture via $! IS the pid that later calls os.setsid() and becomes
# its own process-group leader.
