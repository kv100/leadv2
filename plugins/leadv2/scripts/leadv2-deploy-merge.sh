# leadv2-deploy-merge.sh — Phase 6 fast-forward merge + migration apply + deploy override dispatch.
# Extracted verbatim from commands/leadv2.md Phase 6 bash block (src lines 270-296).
# Run from main repo dir (after ExitWorktree). Requires LEADV2_TASK_ID env var.
# Circuit-breakers: ff-only fail, migration fail, deploy-rc fail — all exit 1.
#
# RISK-7-PERSIST-MERGE-RACE-01: this script runs inside a per-task
# Agent(devops-engineer) tool call — an `exit 1` here only kills that
# subprocess, it does NOT halt the calling lead session before Phase 8. Two
# things close that gap:
#   1. Merge serialization: the FIFO leadv2-merge-queue.sh lock is acquired
#      before the divergence/rebase/push section and released right after
#      COMMIT is captured (NOT held through the slow migration/deploy calls
#      below) — so two concurrent children never both fast-forward main.
#   2. Durable blocker: on any of the 7 ff-only-MERGE-path failure sites
#      (divergence preflight, rebase, ff-only pull/merge — NOT migration-apply
#      or deploy-override failures below, which remain a separate follow-up),
#      merge-blocker.flag is written under docs/handoff/<task>/ before
#      exiting, so Phase 8's A6 check (leadv2-phase8-assert.sh) and every
#      status=done writer (leadv2-tasks-lib.sh::leadv2_tasks_release, reached
#      by render-close.sh AND the daemon/lane-queue release path) see it even
#      in a fresh process/session — a failed ff-only merge can no longer be
#      lying-green closed.
#
# DEPLOY-CLASS-VERIFY-GATE-01 (D4): after a successful deploy_rc==0, ALWAYS
# writes a machine-checkable deploy-verify artifact (schema_version:1 YAML)
# to the control plane (worktree-independent) + a docs/handoff/<id>/ mirror.
# Calls the optional per-repo .claude/leadv2-overrides/deploy-verify.sh hook
# (stdout line protocol); hook absent -> artifact still written with
# targets: [] + producer_gap so leadv2-deploy-verify-check.sh fails-closed
# with an actionable message instead of silently skipping verification. No
# VPS host/service-name/path ever enters this shared script — those live
# only inside the per-repo hook.

# newer files as deletions); only the diff of the tree the merge would
# actually LAND answers. A path that diff changes while no lane commit ever
# named it is the merge silently reverting main on a file the lane never
# touched -- the exact shape of the five 2026-09-03 incidents (clean merge,
# exit 0, no conflict, another lane's file gone; the worst would have
# dropped a 221-line suite). Probe it, refuse it.

# Discriminator: `git log --name-only` emits no patch for merge commits, so
# content that only ever reached the lane via its own mid-flight merge of
# main and was then dropped by a wholesale conflict resolution stays
# unnamed -- exactly the accidental revert. A lane whose own commit deleted
# its own file still lands: that commit names the path. Residual, known: a
# revert baked into a REBASE-replayed commit names the path and is trusted
# (the replay is indistinguishable from a deliberate edit at this point).
#
# Replaces the previous `[[ -x leadv2-merge-safety-gate.sh ]]` call, which
