# leadv2-dispatch-code.sh — the single funnel for out-of-pipeline code-writing dispatch.
# ROUTING-ENFORCEMENT-01 / R1 (founder P1, 2026-07-25). Authoritative spec:
#   docs/handoff/ROUTING-ENFORCEMENT-01/design.md
#
# PROBLEM THIS SOLVES
#   Out-of-pipeline dev has no router: the lead calls Agent(...) or glm-coder.sh directly
#   and is itself the router, so it picks a model on every dispatch and forgets. The in-
#   pipeline resolver (leadv2-router.sh) only governs /leadv2 phases. This script gives
#   out-of-pipeline dev the same shape: ONE dispatch door that reads the SAME routing
#   policy and RESOLVES the model, so the lead never names a model for code work.
#
# WHAT IT DOES (P1 scope)
#   1. ROUTER: reads `glm_policy` from .claude/ref/leadv2-routing.yaml (single source of
#      truth — same block leadv2-router.sh:197-252 reads), applies the same precedence of
#      sonnet_exceptions / opus_only_mission_kinds predicates, and resolves arm=glm|sonnet
#      (opus arms are reported but NOT auto-dispatched — those stay lead judgment). Emits
#      and journals `route_resolved by=router model=<arm> task=<sig8> rule=<id>`.
#   2. ANTI-DOUBLE-SPEND: a task-signature ledger refuses a SECOND dispatch of the same
#      normalized mission (one task = one model), and a review ledger refuses a SECOND
#      review of the same diff-hash (one review). Refusals are journaled.
#
# KILL SWITCH / NO-OP
#   LEADV2_DISPATCH_ENFORCE=0 -> dedup checks are skipped (resolve+journal still run, no
#   refuse), so existing dispatch is unaffected when the router is "off". Default 1.
#   LEADV2_DISPATCH_SPAWN=0 (or --no-spawn) -> resolve+journal only, no worker launched
#   (e.g. for dedup-only tests). Default 1 (spawn IS the default — see WHAT IT DOES §3).
#   Ledger dirs honor LEADV2_DISPATCH_CACHE_DIR (default ~/.claude/cache) so tests are
#   hermetic and never touch the real cache. LEADV2_DISPATCH_GLM_BIN / _SUBSESSION_BIN
#   override the launchers (test seams; each launcher owns its own stub hooks —
#   GLM_CLAUDE_BIN/GLM_RUNS_DIR/GLM_SECRETS_FILE for glm-coder.sh, LEADV2_DRY_RUN for
#   claude-subsession.sh — this script does not duplicate their stubbing logic).
#
# WHAT IT DOES (R1 FIX, 2026-07-25 — adversarial-review Critical #2)
#   3. SPAWN: resolve+record is not enough on its own -- a routed dispatch that only
#      journals and exits deadlocks (the fence denied the original Agent() call; nothing
#      ever relaunches the work). By DEFAULT (kill switch LEADV2_DISPATCH_SPAWN=0 / flag
#      --no-spawn) this script now actually LAUNCHES the resolved worker and returns
#      immediately with its handle: arm=glm -> `glm-coder.sh bg` (detaches via its own
#      setsid+disown, prints a run-id); arm=sonnet -> `claude-subsession.sh` without
#      --wait (forks `run_subsession &`, prints PID+SESSION_ID, exits immediately). Both
#      launchers already own "detach, never block the caller" -- this script does not
#      duplicate that logic, only calls it. arm=opus is never spawned (lead judgment,
#      unchanged). A `worker_spawned by=router model=<arm> task=<sig8> handle=<h>` line is
#      journaled/emitted so a spawn is never silent.
#
# SCOPE NOTES (what this P1 deliberately does NOT do — later design phases)
#   - Does NOT auto-fallback GLM->Sonnet (design §3(c), Phase 4).
#   - Does NOT add the Bash/code-review PreToolUse fences (design Phase 2/4).
#   The resolver predicates mirror leadv2-router.sh:225-252; if that copy changes, update
#   both (Phase 3 extracts a shared `--resolve-glm` sub-mode — until then THIS is the
#   out-of-pipeline copy and the yaml is the single source of the active exception LIST).
#
# WHAT IT DOES (R1 FIX PASS 2, 2026-07-25 — 4 operational bugs from adversarial review)
#   4. The dispatch-ledger reservation (item 2 above) used to be PERMANENT the instant it
#      was written, before the worker was ever confirmed alive. Three bugs fell out of that:
#      (a) a launch failure left the reservation standing -> the identical retry was refused
#          as a duplicate forever (dead task, no path back to GLM/Sonnet).
#      (b) a no-op launcher (exits 0, spawns nothing -- e.g. LEADV2_DISPATCH_GLM_BIN=/bin/true)
#          emitted `worker_spawned` with an EMPTY handle and consumed the reservation: a
#          silent no-op that looked like a successful dispatch.
#      (c) --no-spawn (dry-run/resolve-only) still wrote the SAME permanent reservation, so a
#          preview call poisoned the ledger for the real dispatch that followed it.
#      FIX: the reservation is now provisional. spawn_worker() requires a non-empty handle
#      AND verifies liveness before reporting success (glm: the launcher's own `status`
#      subcommand resolves a live run-dir without this script duplicating its path logic;
#      sonnet: `kill -0` on the PID parsed from claude-subsession.sh's handle line). Any
#      spawn failure (rc!=0, empty handle, or dead liveness check) OR a --no-spawn dry-run
#      rolls the reservation back (originally via a separately-locked atomic_dispatch_
#      rollback() -- FIX PASS 3 below replaced that with a rollback done INSIDE the SAME
#      held lock as the reservation write, closing a race the separate-lock shape left
#      open; see item 5) -- the identical mission is retryable on the next call in every
#      one of those three cases. A caller-supplied
#      `--glm-failures` count is also no longer trusted to flip glm->sonnet on its own
#      (F1 spoof: no real GLM-failure ledger backs it yet) -- a value that would trip the
#      glm_failed_twice rule is capped to 0 and the ignore is journaled.
#
# WHAT IT DOES (R1 FIX PASS 3, 2026-07-25 — race + 4 High from re-review of fix-pass-2)
#   5. CORE FIX: fix-pass-2's reservation was written under flock, the lock was RELEASED,
#      then spawn ran OUTSIDE the lock, then rollback re-acquired the lock. That opened an
#      UNBOUNDED visibility window: caller A reserves+releases, spawn is pending; caller B
#      checks under lock, SEES A's live-looking reservation, is REFUSED; A's spawn then
#      fails and rolls back -- B was wrongly refused for a task that never dispatched.
#      FIX: atomic_dispatch_reserve_spawn_confirm() now holds ONE `flock -w 10 -x 9` across
#      the ENTIRE check -> reserve -> spawn -> confirm/rollback sequence for the glm/sonnet
#      arms. Both launchers' LAUNCH step is non-blocking (verified against source: glm-
#      coder.sh cmd_bg's acquire_lock is a non-blocking mkdir-try that fails fast (exit 75)
#      rather than waiting, then setsid_wrapper+disown backgrounds the real work and prints
#      the run-id; claude-subsession.sh without --wait forks `run_subsession &`, echoes
#      PID+SESSION_ID, exits) -- so the lock is held only for the reservation write plus a
#      sub-second launch, never for the worker's lifetime. A concurrent caller blocking on
#      `flock -w 10` sees, on entry, the FINAL committed state only: a confirmed row ->
#      refuse; no row (rolled back) -> proceed. No visibility window, no reservation-id
#      needed. (arm=opus never spawns, so it keeps using the simpler reserve-only
#      atomic_dispatch_check_and_record -- no race is possible with nothing to roll back.)
#   6. Four High findings fixed alongside the core fix:
#      a. rollback now removes only the EXACT row this call wrote (full-line match via
#         `grep -vxF`), not a blanket task_sig filter -- see _dispatch_append_line /
#         _dispatch_rollback_row_locked.
#      b. cmd_resolve now checks the rollback outcome; a rollback that fails to write
#         (mktemp/mv) is reported as a hard ERROR (`dispatch_rollback_failed`, non-zero
#         exit) -- it never journals a false `dispatch_rolled_back` success.
#      c. the rollback write itself checks its `mv` return code and propagates failure
#         instead of unconditionally succeeding.
#      d. spawn_worker(sonnet) now requires a parseable `PID=` token in the launcher's
#         handle before treating it as live; a handle with no PID is a launch failure
#         (previously: no-PID handles fell through the `kill -0` check untested and were
#         accepted as live).
#
# WHAT IT DOES (FIX PASS 4, 2026-07-25 — REDESIGN: never hold the lock across spawn)
#   7. Fix-pass-3's "one held flock across reserve->spawn->confirm/rollback" was itself
#      BLOCKED on re-review for two fundamental reasons, so this is a structural redesign,
#      not a patch:
#        (A) the flock FD (9) opened by `) 9>"${lockf}"` is inherited by every descendant
#            process forked while it's open -- including a DETACHED worker a launcher
#            backgrounds (glm-coder.sh's setsid_wrapper+disown, claude-subsession.sh's
#            `run_subsession &`). flock's lock is tied to the OPEN FILE DESCRIPTION, not
#            the locking process: even after fix-pass-3's own subshell exited, a detached
#            worker that inherited a copy of fd 9 kept the lock held for the WORKER'S ENTIRE
#            LIFETIME (minutes-to-hours), so the very next dispatch of ANY task_sig in the
#            repo (the lock is per-repo, not per-sig) timed out on `flock -w 10`.
#        (B) the launch step is not sub-second in practice -- GLM's own quota-read can block
#            up to ~15s -- which exceeds `flock -w 10` on its own even without the FD leak,
#            so a concurrent caller could be wrongly refused by a timeout that has nothing to
#            do with an actual duplicate.
#      FIX: the flock critical section NEVER wraps spawn again. Ledger state moves through
#      pending -> confirmed with a per-reservation UNIQUE token (pid + epoch + random/uuid --
#      not a 1-second timestamp, so two same-second callers still get DISTINCT rows) and two
#      TTLs: PENDING_TTL (>=30s, safely above the ~15s max launch -- LEADV2_DISPATCH_PENDING_TTL_S,
#      default 30) and CONFIRMED_TTL (>= a worker's max realistic lifetime -- a live task should
#      never look "free" while it's still legitimately running -- LEADV2_DISPATCH_CONFIRMED_TTL_S,
#      default 7200/2h) so a worker that dies without ever reaching confirm/abort doesn't block
#      re-dispatch of the same task_sig forever.
#        - dispatch_reserve() (short flock, ledger read+append only -- milliseconds): refuses
#          (rc=2) if a CONFIRMED row for the sig is younger than CONFIRMED_TTL, or a PENDING
#          row for the sig is younger than PENDING_TTL (still legitimately in flight). Else
#          appends a PENDING row carrying our unique token and returns it. A ledger WRITE
#          failure (read-only/full fs) is rc=1 -- hard fail, no spawn attempted (mission
#          Finding: "append-fail-then-false-success").
#        - spawn_worker() runs OUTSIDE any held lock, with the lock fd explicitly closed
#          (`9>&-`) on every launcher invocation as defense-in-depth (belt-and-suspenders:
#          the redesign already means no fd 9 is open in this process by the time spawn_worker
#          runs, since dispatch_reserve's flock subshell has already exited by then -- the
#          explicit close guards against a FUTURE regression, or against this script itself
#          being invoked from inside another caller's own fd-9 flock scope).
#        - dispatch_confirm() (short flock): flips OUR row (matched by the EXACT unique token,
#          never a blanket sig filter) from pending to confirmed. Only called after
#          spawn_worker has POSITIVELY verified liveness (glm: run-dir status check; sonnet:
#          `kill -0` on a parsed PID) -- spawn_worker's own binary success/failure return IS
#          the "real liveness or drop the claim" gate: a return of 0 only ever happens after a
#          positive liveness check, so confirming right after never confirms a merely-not-yet-
#          disproven worker.
#        - dispatch_abort() (short flock): removes OUR row (matched by the EXACT unique token)
#          -- never a blanket sig filter, so a concurrent caller's own in-flight row for the
#          SAME sig (legal once ENFORCE=0, or once ours is confirmed and theirs is a distinct
#          later attempt) is never collaterally deleted. Called when spawn_worker fails, or for
#          --no-spawn (dry-run never confirms).
#      Net effect on races: caller B blocking on dispatch_reserve's short flock sees, on entry,
#      only the LATEST committed row for the sig (pending-and-fresh -> refused; pending-and-
#      stale -> reclaimed, B proceeds; confirmed-and-fresh -> refused; none/removed -> B
#      proceeds) -- B is never blocked for the WORKER'S lifetime, only for the sub-millisecond
#      reserve step, so B typically resolves in well under a second even while A's own launch
#      is still mid-flight (refused fast) or has already failed and rolled back (accepted fast).
#      Stale PENDING/expired CONFIRMED rows are never proactively deleted (only exact-token
#      confirm/abort ever rewrites a row) -- they're simply ignored by dispatch_reserve's
#      blocking check once past their TTL; the ledger accumulates orphaned rows from dead
#      launchers over time, an accepted tradeoff (no GC required for correctness).
#
# WHAT IT DOES (DISPATCH-OUTCOME-LEDGER-01, 2026-07-29 -- OUTCOME, not intent)
#   8. The ledger above records that a task was SENT (reserved/confirmed), not whether it
#      was DONE. Incident: three lanes were dispatched to Codex at 0 credits; each returned
#      status=completed/phase=done and produced NOTHING -- no commit, no diff, no evidence --
#      yet their CONFIRMED rows blocked re-dispatch of the identical mission for the full
#      CONFIRMED_TTL (2h), recoverable only by hand-editing the ledger file (--force is, by
#      design, never permitted for dedup). FIX: dispatch_reserve now resolves OUTCOME for a
#      matching CONFIRMED-and-fresh row before treating it as blocking:
#        - _dispatch_worker_liveness(arm, handle) reuses each arm's OWN spawn-time liveness
#          check (glm: glm-coder.sh status; sonnet: kill -0; codex: leadv2-lane-liveness.sh,
#          the shared authoritative-provider-status tool) -- composes with the LANE-SHAPE-01
#          liveness primitives rather than re-deriving them. "alive" or "unknown" (liveness
#          can't be proven) BLOCKS, same as today -- a live or unprovable task is never freed.
#        - Only once liveness says "dead" (finished) does _dispatch_evidence_exists(created_
#          epoch, sig8) run: only a lane-attributed handoff artifact or a commit whose
#          message names sig8 (normally `dispatch-<sig8>`) counts. A clock-only commit from
#          another concurrent lane is never evidence. Handoff artifacts are authoritative
#          because dispatch derives their directory from this exact sig8; commits are
#          authoritative only with the explicit sig8 marker because this ledger does not
#          persist a per-lane worktree ref. A git/stat/input failure defaults to "evidence
#          exists" (blocks) -- the ledger only ever frees a sig it has POSITIVELY proven
#          finished-and-empty.
#      "Runtime state churn" -- lock files, the bus offset store, the cross-worktree
#      active.yaml registry -- is excluded from evidence by EVIDENCE_EXCLUDE_RE (override:
#      LEADV2_DISPATCH_EVIDENCE_EXCLUDE_RE) so a lane that only touched its own bookkeeping
#      is correctly treated as empty, not as having shipped real work.
#      PERFORMANCE (do not repeat FIX PASS 4's mistake): liveness/evidence checks are READ-
#      ONLY external calls (status queries, git log) that can be slow -- they run OUTSIDE the
#      lock, in a first unlocked pass. dispatch_reserve then re-acquires the short flock and
#      re-checks with the ORIGINAL pure/local (awk-only, no external calls) TTL logic,
#      excluding by exact token only the row(s) the unlocked pass already proved reclaimable
#      -- any OTHER row (e.g. a concurrent caller's fresh reservation racing in that tiny
#      window) still blocks normally. The lock is never held across a status/evidence check,
#      exactly as fix-pass-4 requires for spawn.
#      ONE-STEP ROLLBACK: LEADV2_DISPATCH_OUTCOME_LEDGER=0 restores today's behavior exactly
#      -- a CONFIRMED row blocks for the full CONFIRMED_TTL regardless of outcome. Default 1.
#      LEADV2_DISPATCH_EVIDENCE_ATTRIBUTION=0 is the narrower one-step rollback for this
#      attribution rule: it restores the former clock-wide commit check. Default 1.
#
# WHAT IT DOES (DISPATCH-LEDGER-PARTIAL-CLOSE-01, 2026-07-29 -- checkpointed != finished)
#   9. Item 8 above answers "did anything happen?" -- LANE-TURNCAP-CHECKPOINT-01 (220eeaf)
#      made that diverge from "was the mission finished?": a lane cut off at --max-turns now
#      commits whatever it has before dying, so _dispatch_evidence_exists finds a real commit
#      and item 8's outcome resolution reads it as completed work, blocking re-dispatch of a
#      mission that only got partway through. FIX: _dispatch_checkpointed_cutoff(sig8,
#      created_epoch) runs BEFORE the evidence check on a "dead" row and frees it (does not
#      block) when BOTH already-recorded signals say "cut off, never recovered":
#        - docs/handoff/dispatch-<sig8>/CHECKPOINT.md exists with mtime >= created_epoch --
#          the exact artifact LANE-TURNCAP-CHECKPOINT-01 writes the moment session-runner.sh
#          detects turn_cap_exhausted (spawn_worker's sonnet arm always launches with
#          --task-id "dispatch-${sig8}", so this path needs no lookup table).
#        - docs/handoff/dispatch-<sig8>/phase8-passed.flag (session-runner.sh's own SENTINEL,
#          the same "mission finished" proof it uses for completion_proof_present) does NOT
#          exist -- if it does, the lane recovered on a later resume attempt within the SAME
#          reservation and genuinely finished; that case falls through to item 8's ordinary
#          evidence check and stays blocked, unchanged. No third notion of doneness invented
#          -- this composes the checkpoint marker (220eeaf) with the existing sentinel
#          session-runner.sh already treats as authoritative.
#      Never runs on a live or unprovable row (liveness dead-only, same gate as item 8).
#      ONE-STEP ROLLBACK: LEADV2_DISPATCH_CHECKPOINT_CUTOFF=0 disables this carve-out only --
#      a checkpointed-and-cut-off row then falls through to item 8's evidence check exactly as
#      before (blocks, since the checkpoint commit itself counts as evidence). Default 1.

#   Product work is engine/platform/web behaviour.  plugin, tooling, docs, and pure

#   journals its classification and reason.  Product gates each default on and have a

# silently overrides line 242's deliberate "NO -e (refusals must journal)" for the rest of
# this script's execution. With errexit on, every designed-to-be-caught non-zero return
# (dispatch_reserve's rc=2 duplicate, lock timeouts, ledger-write failures, ...) aborts the
# whole process AT THE FAILING STATEMENT instead of reaching the `case`/`emit decision`/
# `printf dispatch_refused` handling a few lines later -- rc leaks out correctly but the
# refusal is never journaled or printed (100% reproducible: pin the exact mechanism with
# `bash -x`, not by theorizing about load/flock contention). Restore immediately after the
# source so a library's own options can never leak into a caller that opted out of them.

# lib/leadv2-glm-policy-resolve.py — see that file for the full rule set + the T-q
# codex_quota_gate / review_arm_exclusions enforcement (job=build here; router.sh passes
# job=review for phase=review). Signals arrive via DC_* env vars set from the caller's
# flags. Prints four lines: arm=<glm|sonnet|opus|codex>  rule=<id|none|...>
# reason=<glm_default|...>  tier=<standard|...|(empty)>

# set, in which case it fails CLOSED to arm=sonnet (reason=*_failclosed, observable).
# MAJOR fix (review-verdict.md dispatch-code.sh:339-376): a lookup relative only to
# this caller's SCRIPT_DIR silently resolved to nothing in a vendored copy that
# missed the lib/ sync (drift) -- resolve_arm()'s own error fallback then read
# that as "resolver errored" and defaulted to the cheap arm, bypassing
# safety/protected-path routing there. Prefer the co-located copy; fall back to

  # simply never asks, regardless of how well the delivery path works. Append

If you hit a decision you cannot safely make yourself (including destructive
options, a policy conflict, or missing authorization), ask via the async
question channel and wait for the answer rather than guessing or stalling:
  bash \"\${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/../../scripts/leadv2-ask.sh\" \"${JOURNAL_TASK}\" \"<question>\" \\
    --option \"a|<reversible label>\" --option \"b|<label>\" --default-option \"a\" [--timeout <sec=1800>]
It blocks until answered via \`/leadv2 reply <q-id> <option>\` and prints the
chosen option. Every question must declare its clearly reversible option with
\`--default-option\`; on timeout the lane proceeds on it and the decision is
journaled and surfaced in open-threads. Without a default, the task is parked
human-needed and its slot is freed. Do not use this for routine progress or
confirmation-seeking; only for a decision you cannot make yourself."
