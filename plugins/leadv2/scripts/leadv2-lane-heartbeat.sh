# leadv2-lane-heartbeat.sh — durable per-task heartbeat + uniform liveness (PULSE-01).
#
# PROBLEM (2026-07-29, jcode design import #2 — see memory
# reference-external-repos-evaluated-reject): liveness was GUESSED from a
# stream file's mtime. Both directions failed in one day: twice a live lane
# quiet-but-alive was announced dead; three Codex lanes reported
# status=completed having produced nothing (an exhausted provider still
# answers "done"). "Alive" and "did it do anything" were both guesses.
#
# FIX: a durable heartbeat field in the existing registry (docs/leadv2/
# active.yaml, via leadv2-active-registry.sh's new heartbeat/mark_finished
# ops) plus ONE reader that computes a verdict the SAME way for every arm
# (Codex app-server job, GLM job, local Sonnet subagent) — no ps/pgrep, no
# stream-mtime guessing. A crashed lane cannot write its own heartbeat, so
# staleness is ALWAYS the coordinator's read of heartbeat AGE, never a
# self-report. "I don't know" is representable as its own state
# (running_stale) instead of being folded into either extreme.
#
# VERDICT VOCABULARY (see resolve_verdict() below for the exact rules):
#   running        — heartbeat age <= threshold, no terminal report yet.
#   running_stale  — heartbeat age >  threshold, no terminal report yet.
#                    NOT dead — the honest "I don't know" state.
#   dead           — heartbeat stale AND a LOCAL pid is confirmed gone.
#                    Only reachable for arms that register a local pid
#                    (Sonnet); a Codex/GLM row with no pid never resolves to
#                    dead from this reader — running_stale is its ceiling.
#   completed      — terminal_status=completed AND evidence is non-empty.
#   finished_empty — terminal_status=completed but evidence is empty/absent,
#                    OR terminal_status=finished_empty explicitly. This is
#                    the fix for "provider says done, produced nothing."
#   failed / cancelled — passthrough of an explicit terminal report.
#
# SCOPE OF THIS PASS: the write side (heartbeat/mark_finished ops + this
# reader) is complete and arm-agnostic. Wiring every producer (the Sonnet
# EYES pulse.json hook, the Codex/GLM job-registry watchdog in
# the now-retired supervisor loop) to call `beat`/`finish` on their own cadence is
# the natural next step, deliberately left as follow-up so this diff stays
# reviewable and one-step-revertible — see ROLLBACK below. `sync-from-pulse`
# gives any caller a ready-made bridge from the existing pulse.json artifact
# without touching that hook's <50ms/no-python3 hot-path budget.
#
# ROLLBACK: LEADV2_LANE_LIVENESS_LEGACY=1 makes any NEW caller of this
# script's `status` a no-op that defers entirely to the old inference (exit
# 3, prints nothing) — existing mtime-based callers (leadv2-supervise.sh's
# pulse_verdict) are untouched by this file and keep working exactly as
# before regardless of this flag.
#
# Shared plugin — nothing repo-specific. Per-repo variation via
# .claude/leadv2-overrides/ (none needed today).
