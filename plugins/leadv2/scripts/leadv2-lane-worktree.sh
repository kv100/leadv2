# leadv2-lane-worktree.sh — one git worktree per leadv2 lane, on its own branch.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS (LANE-WORKTREE-ISOLATION-01, 2026-07-27): every leadv2 lane
# used to run in the ONE shared main checkout with ONE shared git index. That
# single fact clobbered docs/tasks.yaml twice in one day (92763d76 reverted 89
# statuses / deleted 32 rows from a base that never saw the 03:04 reconcile;
# dc22ad79 reverted 47af84254005 done->queued while filing an unrelated task),
# swept one lane's staged code into an unrelated docs commit (b74d70d6,
# SD-SHARED-INDEX-SWEPT-A-COMMIT-01 — explicit `git add <paths>` is not enough,
# only `git commit <paths>` is), and killed a lane that read another lane's
# half-written file (SD-LANES-HAVE-NO-WORKTREE-01).
#
# SD-LANES-HAVE-NO-WORKTREE-01 found the precise gap: Phase 0 of `/leadv2` is
# specified to call the EnterWorktree tool, but headless fanout children never
# reliably do — `git worktree list` showed only the main tree while N lanes
# edited it concurrently. leadv2-fanout.sh's own header claimed isolation "is
# handled by Phase 0 of the spawned session itself"; that assumption is false
# for headless/tmux/windowed children. This script is the deterministic,
# bash-level fix: leadv2-fanout.sh calls `ensure` BEFORE launching a lane and
# runs the child with cwd = the returned worktree, so isolation no longer
# depends on the spawned session's own tool-call judgment.
#
# Reuse, not reinvention: this script only CREATES the lane worktree. It uses
# the SAME path/branch convention EnterWorktree itself uses
# (.claude/worktrees/<name>, branch worktree-<name>), so the machinery that
# already exists downstream applies unchanged:
#   - Landing: Phase 6 `ExitWorktree(action="keep")` + leadv2-deploy-merge.sh,
#     which already does a divergence preflight + rebase + FF-ONLY merge (a
#     real conflict on overlapping docs/tasks.yaml edits is a loud non-zero
#     exit + merge-blocker.flag, never a silent pick-one-side) + `git push`.
#     leadv2-deploy-merge.sh already resolves the task branch as
#     `task/$TASK_ID` or `worktree-$TASK_ID` — this script only ever creates
#     the latter, so no changes were needed there.
#   - Reaping: Phase 8 `leadv2-worktree-cleanup.sh --name "$TASK_ID"` (already
#     called from commands/leadv2.md's Phase 8 step, success path only).
#
# Ops:
#   ensure <task_id> [class]   create the lane worktree+branch if absent
#                              (idempotent), print the ABS worktree path to
#                              stdout. On ANY failure: log loud to stderr and
#                              print PROJECT_ROOT (legacy shared tree) so
#                              dispatch NEVER hard-breaks — isolation degrades
#                              to the old behavior, it does not stop the lane.
#   path-of <task_id>          print the lane's ABS worktree path, or "" if no
#                              worktree exists for that task.
#
# Env:
#   LEADV2_PROJECT_ROOT   repo whose main checkout lanes fork from (required;
#                         falls back to the git toplevel of cwd).
#   LEADV2_WORKTREE_DIR   parent dir for lane worktrees
#                         (default $ROOT/.claude/worktrees — same dir
#                         EnterWorktree and leadv2-worktree-cleanup.sh use).
#   LEADV2_LANE_WORKTREE  on|off (default on). off => ensure prints PROJECT_ROOT
#                         and creates nothing (legacy escape hatch / kill-switch).
#   LEADV2_LANE_BASE      ref to fork the lane from (default: origin/main if it
#                         exists, else main, else HEAD).
#   LEADV2_LANE_WORKTREE_ERRF  stderr capture file (default /tmp/pe-lane-worktree.err).
#
# Branch naming: refs/heads/worktree-<task_id>  (matches EnterWorktree +
#                                                 leadv2-deploy-merge.sh)
# Worktree path:  $LEADV2_WORKTREE_DIR/<task_id>  (== .claude/worktrees/<task_id>)
#
# Exit codes: 0 always (ensure/path-of never block a lane; ensure falls back to
# the shared tree on any git failure instead of failing the dispatch).

# registered by hand; product repos' were not, so every worktree lane silently
# lost its Codex arm.
