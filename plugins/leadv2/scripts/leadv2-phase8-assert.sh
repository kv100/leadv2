# Best-effort warnings (log_warning + continue; never exit 1):

# claimed_done/needs_evidence are the store's deliberate "work is done, an

# terminal: A2 passes them ONLY when BOTH a release receipt (the sentinel
# leadv2_tasks_release writes) AND this task's own phase-8 evidence artifact
# ($SENTINEL, i.e. phase8-passed.flag) exist on disk -- proof the lane
# actually finished the work, not merely that the store reached one of these
# statuses by some other path. queued/pending/in_progress/unknown status
# still FAIL -- this must never become "always pass".
# fix-round-1 Finding 3: derived from the single shared source
# (leadv2_tasks_yaml_common.py) instead of a hardcoded literal, so drift
# there (e.g. a status added/removed) propagates here automatically instead
# of creating a 4th silently-stale copy. Literal fallback below only fires
# if the shared module can't be imported at all (e.g. corrupted install) --
# kept identical to the shared constant so behavior is unchanged either way.
## NOTE: these two derivation blocks deliberately avoid a bare `import sys`
## first line (test-leadv2-phase8-assert-a2-schema.sh's _extract_a2_python
## greps for the literal `^import sys$` to locate the REAL A2 heredoc below
## -- a bare `import sys` here would false-match and corrupt the extraction).
