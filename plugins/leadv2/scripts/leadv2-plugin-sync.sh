# leadv2-plugin-sync.sh — Idempotent sync of plugin scripts/contracts/workflows/hooks
# from the canonical plugin source tree to all runtime locations.
#
# Syncs to:
#   (a) ~/.claude/plugins/cache/leadv2-local/leadv2/0.1.0/  (full plugin cache)
#   (b) ~/.claude/leadv2-shared/                            (scripts + contracts + hooks)
#   (c) <project>/.claude/scripts/                          (per-repo runtimes from cross-repo-paths.yaml)
#   (d) <project>/.claude/contracts/                        (schema files per-repo)
#   (e) ~/.claude/scripts/                                  (user-global leadv2-* scripts; ADDITIVE, no --delete)
#   (f) ~/.codex/skills/source-command-leadv2/              (Codex leadv2 skill; enables provider=codex lead sessions)
#
# (c)/(d): reads project roots from ~/.claude/leadv2-shared/cross-repo-paths.yaml.
# Missing root on disk → WARN + skip (never silent).
# --project-root overrides to a single root (bypasses yaml iteration).
#
# Also calls leadv2-workflows-sync.sh to sync JS workflow files to ~/.claude/workflows/.
#
# Usage:
#   bash leadv2-plugin-sync.sh [--dry-run] [--project-root <path>]
#
# --dry-run      Print what would change; no writes.
# --project-root Sync (c)/(d) to this single root only (skips yaml iteration).
#
# Idempotent: safe to re-run after any plugin edit.

# ── Direction-safety (sync_direction_safety decision) ────────────────────────
# Before a --delete rsync push overwrites a target file with different
# content, refuse (don't guess) unless canonical's OWN git history for that
# relative path ever held exactly that content. A downstream copy carrying
# an un-landed fix canonical hasn't seen yet is exactly what silently got
# clobbered in the incident this task fixes.
#
# MODE (1st arg) controls what happens to a file deemed UNSAFE (dst content
# not reachable anywhere in canonical's git history for that relpath):
#   exclude  Emit the relpath so the caller --exclude's it; LEAVE THE COPY
#            UNTOUCHED (hard block). Use ONLY where in-place local development
#            is plausible AND the target is NOT checked by leadv2-drift-guard.sh
#            — i.e. (e) ~/.claude/scripts.
#   warn     QUARANTINE the copy's current content to a timestamped dir, THEN
#            emit nothing so rsync OVERWRITES the copy with canonical
#            (reconcile). Quarantine-then-reconcile (round-2): warn WITHOUT
#            quarantine was the e399c95 regression Codex caught — it logged a
#            loud warning and then clobbered the copy anyway, so a real
#            un-landed fix was lost exactly as the 2026-07-16 incident lost 3
#            committed fixes (a warning in a log nobody reads is not a guard).
#            Quarantine keeps the content one `cp` away from recovery into
#            canonical, while the overwrite keeps the guard satisfiable — the
#            property BOTH prior modes failed: exclude trapped divergent copies
#            forever (unsatisfiable guard); plain warn ate fixes (decorative
#            protection). Use for every guard-checked copy: (a) cache, (b)
#            shared, (f) vendored, across every warn-mode subdir.
# COPY_NAME (2nd arg): logical copy id (e.g. cache/hooks, shared/scripts,
#            leadv2-repo-vendored/scripts) — disambiguates the same relpath
#            across copies inside one quarantine timestamp dir and names the
#            recovery path in the warning.
#
# Why reconcile (not exclude) for guard-checked copies (DRIFT-GUARD-UNSATISFIABLE-01):
# exclude mode left a divergent copy unreconcilable — rsync skipped it, the copy
# stayed divergent, re-running sync never cleared it, leadv2-drift-guard exited 1
# permanently with a remedy that provably could not work; the reflex became
# LEADV2_SKIP_DRIFT_GUARD=1. ~/Projects/leadv2/.claude/scripts/ (the vendored
# copy) is gitignored+untracked in canonical's own repo, so once it diverges its
# content can NEVER be in canonical's git history — exclude mode trapped it
# forever. Verified live: exclude mode also refused to clear a 1-byte hand-edit
# on plugin-cache, so this is a class bug, not vendored-specific. Reconcile
# WITH quarantine is the only mode that both clears drift and loses nothing.
