#!/usr/bin/env bash
# scripts/leadv2-session-runner.sh — daemon-mode completion loop for a fanned-out
# /leadv2 session (SUPERVISOR-RETRO-01 item 2).
#
# THE GAP this fixes: headless launch used `claude -p "/leadv2 $tid"` with no
# --model/--effort and no resume-on-exit — a session that exited mid-phase
# (rate limit, crash, `claude -p` returning without a completed task) just
# stopped; nobody restarted it toward close. tmux launch had the same gap
# plus registered `daemon=false` even though nothing else acted as a daemon.
#
# THIS SCRIPT is the provider-neutral entrypoint. For provider=claude it owns
# the plan->build->review->deploy-gate->verify->close retry loop below. For
# provider=codex it execs leadv2-codex-session-runner.sh, which implements the
# same full Phase 0..8 + final-sentinel contract with Codex thread resumes.
#
# Required env:
#   LEADV2_TASK_ID     — the task id this runner drives to close.
#
# Optional env (fanout.sh sets these; safe defaults below for standalone runs):
#   LEADV2_LEAD_MODEL    (default: sonnet)
#   LEADV2_LEAD_EFFORT   (default: medium)
#   LEADV2_DAEMON        (default: 1) — informational; always daemon-mode here.
#   LEADV2_ASYNC_QUESTIONS (default: 1) — REQUIRED so the spawned /leadv2
#       session routes founder-facing questions through scripts/leadv2-ask.sh
#       instead of AskUserQuestion (nobody is watching this worktree's TTY).
#       Only a typed founder decision may reach leadv2-ask.sh; routine phase
#       boundaries must never block on an interactive prompt.
#   LEADV2_FANOUT          (default: 1) — informational marker for the child.
#   LEADV2_RUNNER_MAX_ATTEMPTS (default: 6) — resume attempts before giving up.
#   LEADV2_RUNNER_RETRY_SLEEP_S (default: 5) — backoff between resume attempts.
#   LEADV2_FANOUT_CLAUDE_BIN (default: claude) — override for tests (mirrors
#       scripts/leadv2-fanout.sh's CLAUDE_BIN convention).
#   LEADV2_SESSION_PROVIDER (default: claude) — claude|codex|glm|kimi. `auto`
#       must be resolved by leadv2-session-route.sh before this runner is launched.
#   LEADV2_CLAUDE_MAX_TURNS (default: 150) — per-attempt runaway guard. A
#       nine-phase Heavy pipeline routinely needs more than 30 tool turns;
#       each resumed attempt receives this fresh budget. Set the variable to
#       override the default for a specific lane. Raised 60->150: false-kill
#       cost > runtime cost — a nine-phase Heavy pipeline plus recovery
#       routinely exceeds 60 tool turns, and a cap death costs a full
#       re-dispatch.
#   LEADV2_CLAUDE_MAX_BUDGET_USD — optional per-attempt API budget ceiling.
#
# Idempotency: a per-task flock (docs/handoff/<task>/.session-runner.lock)
# refuses a second concurrent runner for the same task. The completion
# sentinel is docs/handoff/<task>/phase8-passed.flag, written by
# scripts/leadv2-phase8-assert.sh only after the hard close assertions. That
# script also writes a shared control-plane completion receipt so a runner in
# the main checkout can observe closure performed inside a linked worktree.
# Deploy/phase side-effect
# idempotency itself lives in the phase-advance/phase8/finish scripts (also
# out of scope here); this runner's contribution is the imperative resume
# prompt explicitly instructing the resumed session to re-check sentinels
# before repeating any side-effecting step — never re-running blind.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 — canonical Phase-8 sentinel or shared completion receipt observed
#   1 — bad usage / missing LEADV2_TASK_ID
#   2 — lock held by another live runner for this task
#   3 — max resume attempts exhausted without reaching the sentinel

# BUG-A/BUG-B fix (FIX-HEADLESS-RUNNER-01): two prior defects collapsed into
# one guarded block. (1) `readonly PROJECT_ROOT` unconditionally errored if
# this variable was already readonly in the process (e.g. re-sourced) — guard
# with declare -p so the block is a no-op on a second entry. (2) the fallback
# never checked LEADV2_PROJECT_ROOT / CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR (unlike
# leadv2-fanout.sh and leadv2-codex-session-runner.sh, which both do) AND used
# `$SCRIPT_DIR/../..` — two levels up from scripts/, one too many for this
# repo's flat `<repo>/scripts/` layout. Net effect verified live: headless
# children launched `claude -p` with cwd=/Users/.../Projects (parent of the
# repo) instead of the repo root, so `/leadv2 <task>` printed "Unknown
# command: /leadv2" and exited rc=0 every attempt — no worktree, no phase
# progress, eventual stall-kill. Fixed depth to `$SCRIPT_DIR/..` (one level).
