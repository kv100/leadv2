# leadv2-supervise-pick.sh — SUPERVISE-V2-01 F1 (batch-2 item 2): read-only
# task picker. Input: docs/tasks.yaml top-N queued candidates (via the
# existing leadv2-tasks-lib.sh shared-lock reader — never a second tasks
# store, never a hand-edit) + a cached truth-probe breach snapshot (item 3's
# output, if present). Output: ranked JSON of <=10 candidates
# {id, title, priority, lane, recommend, reason} for the LEAD to present via
# AskUserQuestion. This script NEVER dispatches/claims/launches anything —
# read-only, no side effects, safe to call every reconciliation cycle.
#
# Usage:
#   leadv2-supervise-pick.sh [N]     # N defaults to 10, capped at 10
#
# A RED truth breach ranks its linked work item first (codex-plan step 5:
# "A RED breach already reconciled to a work item is ranked ahead of
# ordinary queued work"); this script does NOT create the work item itself —
# that's existing truth-reconciliation's job, out of scope here. If the
# breach snapshot is missing/stale/malformed, truth_probe reports
# "unavailable" and ranking degrades to plain queue order — never silently
# treated as "no breaches" being asserted as fact.
#
# Env overrides (test sandboxing): LEADV2_PROJECT_ROOT / CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR /
# PROJECT_ROOT — repo root (same fail-closed order as leadv2-supervise.sh).
