# leadv2-tasks-clobber-guard.sh — TASKS-YAML-STALE-BASE-CLOBBER-01 (c4e91a70b83d)
#
# A lane that holds a STALE copy of docs/tasks.yaml and writes the whole file
# back (via Edit/Write, bypassing leadv2-tasks-lib.sh) silently erases every
# other lane's work the moment it commits — proven twice in one day
# (92763d76 dropped 32 in-flight rows incl. live P0 a9f34c02e7d1; dc22ad79
# reverted 47af84254005 from done back to queued). The lib's flock only
# serialises lib writers; it cannot see a lane that writes the file directly.
# This guard is the load-bearing backstop: it runs at `git commit` time, so it
# catches EVERY writer regardless of whether the lib was used.
#
# It compares the staged docs/tasks.yaml against HEAD:docs/tasks.yaml and
# BLOCKS the commit when the staged version either:
#   (G1) drops an IN-FLIGHT id — an id that was NON-terminal in HEAD and is
#        absent from the staged tree (the data-loss case: live work erased), OR
#   (G2) regresses an id — terminal in HEAD, non-terminal in staged (the
#        done→queued revert case),
# unless EVERY blocked id is named in the commit message (the legitimate
# "reopen <id>" / "drop <id>" escape hatch) OR PE_SKIP_TASKS_CLOBBER_GUARD=1.
#
# Dropping a TERMINAL id is ALLOWED (that is the archive path — finished rows
# leaving tasks.yaml), so a legit archive commit is not blocked. A normal
# status flip that only adds terminals (e.g. queued→done) is allowed.
#
# Usage:
#   leadv2-tasks-clobber-guard.sh                 # pre-commit mode: reads git
#   leadv2-tasks-clobber-guard.sh --check <head.yaml> <staged.yaml> <msg>
#        # core comparison against explicit files (for tests; no git needed)
#
# Env:
#   PE_SKIP_TASKS_CLOBBER_GUARD=1   bypass (prints a visible BYPASSED line)
#
# Exit codes: 0 = commit may proceed; 1 = commit blocked (named ids printed).
