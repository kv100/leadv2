"""Shared tolerant loader for docs/tasks.yaml (GATE-A2-FIX-01, 2026-07-15).

docs/tasks.yaml can legitimately be either:
  - a bare top-level list of task dicts (the classic tasks-lib.sh /
    lane-yaml shape), or
  - a mapping with a list-bearing key, e.g. {"total_open": N, "tasks": [...]}
    -- this is what persona-engine's scripts/task-sync-yaml.sh writes
    (a Supabase work_items projection; see leadv2-fanout.sh for a prior,
    already-correct reference implementation of this same tolerance).

Every script that reads docs/tasks.yaml (or an equivalent lane yaml) MUST
route through load_tasks_items() instead of re-deriving the
`isinstance(x, list) else []` check inline. A bare `yaml.safe_load(f) or []`
silently drops every task when the file is mapping-shaped (a truthy dict
never falls back to `[]`), and the resulting `for it in <dict>` iterates
the dict's string KEYS -- `it.get(...)` on a str then raises AttributeError,
which most callers swallow via `2>/dev/null` or a bare `except Exception`,
turning a real task lookup into a false "not found" / false "empty queue"
signal. Proven incident: leadv2-phase8-assert.sh A2 reported "task not
found" for a task that was actually `status: done` in a mapping-shaped
docs/tasks.yaml.

Import contract: callers that are `python3 -` heredoc scripts (no
`__file__`) must pass the scripts directory as an extra argv element and do
`sys.path.insert(0, sys.argv[N])` before `from leadv2_tasks_yaml_common
import load_tasks_items`. Callers that are real .py files under this same
directory can just `sys.path.insert(0, os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__)))`.
