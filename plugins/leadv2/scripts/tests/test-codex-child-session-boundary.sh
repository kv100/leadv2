# Regression guard: a Codex lead launched by the session runner must execute
# phases itself, never recurse into a runner/dispatcher.
# run-all-triggers: leadv2-codex-session-runner leadv2-fanout leadv2-session-runner
#
# SUITE-SELECTION-COVERS-140-OF-390-01: this suite carried no trigger
# marker and matched no name convention, so `run-all.sh --scope changed`
# never selected it — it could only ever run under `--scope all`. The
# triggers are the production files the suite's own body references most,
# with shared helpers excluded so a helper edit does not select everything.
