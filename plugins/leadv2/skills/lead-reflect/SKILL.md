# Lead Reflect

## When
- Phase 8 Close, Step 2 (called by leadv2-close after graph-reflect footprint is captured)
- Before `/compact` on tasks with ≥20 turns (preserves key patterns before context wipe)

## When NOT
- Mid-task (only at close or pre-compact)
- If task ended in DELIVERABLE_BLOCKED with no work produced

---

## §1. Inputs expected from leadv2-close

| Variable | Source |
|---|---|
| `$LEADV2_TASK_ID` | env or context.yaml |
| `$GRAPH_FOOTPRINT` | leadv2-close Step 1b output (null if unavailable) |
| `$TOTAL_COST_USD` | costs.yaml sum (null if telemetry missing) |

---

## §2. Load task context

```bash
# Read context.yaml for metadata
task_id="$LEADV2_TASK_ID"
context_file="docs/handoff/${task_id}/context.yaml"
```

Read:
- `class` (Standard / Heavy / Light)
- `title`
- `plan.parallel_groups` (which groups ran, which were blocked)
- `decisions` (D1..Dn) — list count
- `off_limits` — list count

---

## §3. Reflection fields

Fill each field based on task evidence (commit diff, handoff files, cost telemetry).
Keep each field ≤ 30 words. No speculation — ground in concrete task events.

### `almost_missed`
One thing that almost went wrong or was caught late in the task.
Example: "Partial unique index on snapshots broke batch upsert — caught in verify not plan."

### `opus_needed_for`
If any step truly required Opus (strategic decision, ADR, ambiguous spec resolution) — name it.
If nothing required Opus: `"none — sonnet sufficient throughout"`.

### `parallel_win`
Whether running parallel groups (F1||F2 pattern) saved wall time.
Format: `"<groups> ran parallel; saved ~<N>min"` or `"no parallel opportunity"`.

### `codex_rounds`
Integer 0–3. Number of Codex review rounds that triggered actionable revisions (not cosmetic).

### `pattern_for_immune`
A trigger → action rule suitable for immune memory.
Format: `"<condition> → <action>"`.
Example: `"PostgREST upsert PGRST102 on partial index → use rpc() fallback or restructure index"`

Only emit a pattern if confidence is HIGH (seen in this task + consistent with prior tasks).
If no strong pattern: `"none"`.

---

## §4. Signature block

```yaml
signature:
  subagents_spawned: <int>        # count of developer/critic/architect spawns
  codex_rounds: <int>             # same as reflect.codex_rounds
  parallel_groups: <int>          # count of parallel_groups in context.yaml.plan
  decisions_logged: <int>         # count of D-decisions in context.yaml
  off_limits_respected: true      # always true unless a violation was noted
  task_cost_usd: <float | null>
```

<!-- §4.5 Causal critique DELETED 2026-09-12 (REFLECT-SELF-LEARNING-DECISION,
     VERDICT delete): the critique workflow and its doc were retired with the
     self-learning loop; the §5a fold-in that read the critique tempfile went
     with them, so the entry is byte-identical to the pre-critique shape. -->

## §5. Append to STATE history and reflect-history.yaml

### §5a. Append structured entry to `docs/leadv2/reflect-history.yaml` (canonical machine record)

This is the primary machine-readable record consumed by phase8-assert A4
and force-reflect. Write it FIRST, before the human board line.

```bash
REFLECT_HISTORY="docs/leadv2/reflect-history.yaml"

# Build the YAML entry (use python3 for safe multiline quoting)
python3 - <<PYEOF
import yaml, datetime, os, json

entry = {
    "task": "${task_id}",
    "closed_at": datetime.datetime.now(datetime.timezone(datetime.timedelta(hours=2))).isoformat(timespec='minutes'),
    "reflect": {
        "almost_missed": "${almost_missed}",
        "opus_needed_for": "${opus_needed_for}",
        "parallel_win": "${parallel_win}",
        "codex_rounds": ${codex_rounds},
        "pattern_for_immune": "${pattern_for_immune}",
        "fix_quality": "${fix_quality}",
    },
    "signature": {
        "phase": "${phase}",
        "task_class": "${task_class}",
        "failure_class": "${failure_class}",
        "recovery_decision": "${recovery_decision}",
        "outcome": "${outcome}",
        "involved_agents": ${involved_agents_json},
        "change_kind": "${change_kind}",
    },
}

path = "${REFLECT_HISTORY}"
try:
    with open(path, encoding="utf-8") as fh:
        data = yaml.safe_load(fh) or {}
except FileNotFoundError:
    data = {}

entries = data.get("entries") or []
entries.append(entry)
data["entries"] = entries

# Atomic write: write to tmp, then rename
tmp = path + ".tmp"
with open(tmp, "w", encoding="utf-8") as fh:
    yaml.dump(data, fh, allow_unicode=True, default_flow_style=False, sort_keys=False)
os.replace(tmp, path)
print(f"[lead-reflect] reflect-history.yaml updated: {len(entries)} entries")
PYEOF
```

Shell variable substitution applies — fill in the reflect field values from §3/§4 before running.

### §5c. Write knowledge archive entry to `docs/leadv2/knowledge/<NN>_<task-slug>.md`

One grep-able entry per completed task, written once at close. If the file already
exists, leave it as-is rather than overwriting.

```bash
KNOWLEDGE_DIR="${CWD}/docs/leadv2/knowledge"
mkdir -p "$KNOWLEDGE_DIR"

python3 - <<PYEOF
import os, re, datetime

knowledge_dir = "${KNOWLEDGE_DIR}"
task_id       = "${task_id}"

# Derive slug from task_id (lower, alphanum+hyphen, max 40 chars)
slug = re.sub(r'[^a-z0-9-]', '-', task_id.lower())[:40].strip('-')

# Next sequence number (NN = max existing + 1, zero-padded to 2 digits)
existing = [f for f in os.listdir(knowledge_dir) if re.match(r'^\d+_', f)]
nn = max((int(re.match(r'^(\d+)_', f).group(1)) for f in existing), default=0) + 1
filename = os.path.join(knowledge_dir, f"{nn:02d}_{slug}.md")

if os.path.exists(filename):
    print(f"[lead-reflect] knowledge entry already exists: {filename}")
else:
    # Pull decisions from context.yaml
    import yaml
    ctx = {}
    ctx_path = f"docs/handoff/${task_id}/context.yaml"
    try:
        with open(ctx_path) as fh:
            ctx = yaml.safe_load(fh) or {}
    except FileNotFoundError:
        pass

    decisions_raw = ctx.get("decisions") or []
    decisions_md  = "\n".join(f"- {d}" for d in decisions_raw) if decisions_raw else "- (none recorded)"
    title         = ctx.get("title") or task_id
    closed_at     = datetime.datetime.now(datetime.timezone(datetime.timedelta(hours=2))).strftime("%Y-%m-%d")

    content = f"""# {nn:02d} {slug}

**Task:** {title}
**Closed:** {closed_at}

## Decisions
{decisions_md}

## Gotchas
- {("${almost_missed}" or "(none)").strip()}

## Pattern
`{("${pattern_for_immune}" or "none").strip()}`
"""
    with open(filename, "w") as fh:
        fh.write(content)
    print(f"[lead-reflect] knowledge archive entry written: {filename}")
PYEOF
```

Shell variable substitution applies — `${almost_missed}` and `${pattern_for_immune}` must be set from §3 before running.

---

### §5b. Append human board line to `docs/LEAD_V2_STATE.md` under `history:` section

```yaml
  - task: <task_id>
    closed_at: <ISO timestamp Kyiv UTC+2>
    task_cost_usd: <float | null>
    reflect:
      almost_missed: "<string>"
      opus_needed_for: "<string>"
      parallel_win: "<string>"
      codex_rounds: <int>
      pattern_for_immune: "<string>"
    signature:
      subagents_spawned: <int>
      codex_rounds: <int>
      parallel_groups: <int>
      decisions_logged: <int>
      off_limits_respected: true
      task_cost_usd: <float | null>
    graph_footprint: <block or omit>
    outcome_watch: pending
```

If `history:` has >20 entries: rotate oldest entries to `docs/ops/LEAD_HISTORY.md` (append), keep only last 20 in STATE.md.

After BOTH writes are complete, mark reflect as done so the Stop-hook force-reflect guard (`leadv2-force-reflect.sh`) does not re-fire:

```bash
for d in "docs/handoff/${LEADV2_TASK_ID}" "docs/leadv2/tasks/${LEADV2_TASK_ID}"; do
  [[ -d "$d" ]] && touch "$d/reflect-done.flag"
done
```

---

## §6. Append to per-task STATE.md

Also append a brief reflection summary to `docs/leadv2/tasks/<task_id>/STATE.md` under `## History`:

```markdown
## History

### <ISO timestamp>
- Closed phase 8. Cost: $<N> (or unknown).
- almost_missed: <string>
- pattern_for_immune: <string>
```

---

## §6.5. Call leadv2-correction-detect

Before immune memory integration (§7), invoke correction-detect on the session — gated by
`LEADV2_CORRECTION_DETECT` (default `0`, meaning skip). Non-blocking: a failure or empty result
just falls through to §7.

For the exact gate check, sourcing snippet, and what correction-detect does when enabled, see
[REFERENCE.md § Correction-detect](./REFERENCE.md#correction-detect).

---

## §7. Immune memory integration

If `reflect.pattern_for_immune != "none"`:

1. Check `${CLAUDE_PROJECT_MEMORY_DIR:-$HOME/.claude/projects/$(pwd | tr '/' '-' | sed 's/^-//')/memory}/MEMORY.md` — does this pattern already exist?
2. If yes: skip (idempotent).
3. If no: propose a new feedback memory entry via `Write` to a temp file, then note it in the task STATE.md for founder approval. Do NOT auto-write to MEMORY.md without founder approval — that is a strategist-only action.

Exception: if the pattern was auto-promoted by leadv2-correction-detect (confidence ≥ 0.95, category=correction), it was already written directly. Skip duplication check — just log "auto-promoted by correction-detect" in STATE.md.

---

## §7.5. Weekly skill-usage tally (best-effort, ~1×/week)

Once per ISO week, append a snapshot of skill wiring/usage to the log so dormant
skills get surfaced. Cheap — runs ~7 grep passes, no network. Non-blocking — the log
file may not exist on first run; the script creates it.

For the week-gate check and the exact append command, see
[REFERENCE.md § Weekly skill-usage tally](./REFERENCE.md#weekly-skill-usage-tally).

---

## §8. Graph footprint risk cross-validation

If `$GRAPH_FOOTPRINT != null`:

- Check if any files in the footprint are listed in `context.yaml.off_limits`.
- If yes: log a warning in the task STATE.md: `"WARN: footprint includes off_limits path <path>"`.
- This is post-hoc audit only — close proceeds regardless.

---

## Rules

- Ground reflection in concrete task evidence, not self-congratulatory framing. "No issues" is valid if true.
- `pattern_for_immune` must be a falsifiable, concrete condition — vague guidance like "be careful" doesn't qualify.
- If `GRAPH_FOOTPRINT` is null, omit the `graph_footprint:` key from the history entry entirely.
- Reuse deliverable summaries already captured in handoff instead of re-reading files.
- All output from this skill goes to STATE.md files — nothing is emitted to chat.
