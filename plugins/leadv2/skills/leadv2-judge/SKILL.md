# /leadv2 Unified Judge

## When

Lead needs an Opus verdict and the mode is clear. Pass `--mode` to select the decision type:

| Mode | Trigger condition |
|---|---|
| `review` | Phase 5: ≥2 reviewers with conflicting verdicts |
| `question` | Founder asked a judgment question during active task |
| `recovery` | Phase failed AND at least 1 retry attempt consumed |

## When NOT

- All reviewers agree → no judge needed (use that verdict directly).
- First failure → automatic retry, skip judge entirely.
- After 3 failures → automatic escalate, skip judge.
- Founder said "ответь сам" → skip judge.

### Mode `review` — Codex gut-check before spawning (added 2026-06-30, SONNET5-ADAPT-01)

Before spawning this Opus judge for a critic-vs-codex conflict specifically (codex was itself one of the disagreeing reviewers), re-fire Codex once fresh at `--effort medium` as a gut-check re-confirmation — reuses the existing "Round 2 tie-break" pattern from `leadv2-plan/SKILL.md`. Codex cannot adjudicate its own round-1 disagreement, so this is a re-confirmation, not an appeal:

```bash
bash .claude/scripts/lv2 leadv2-codex-planner.sh \
  --task-id "<task-id>" --mode reconfirm --effort medium --tier standard \
  --prior-verdict "docs/handoff/<task-id>/codex.summary.md" \
  --out "docs/handoff/<task-id>/codex-reconfirm.md"
```

If Codex round 2 flips to APPROVE → skip the Opus judge spawn entirely, advance with that verdict. Only on genuine persistent disagreement (round 2 still REVISE/ABORT) does this mode proceed to the Opus judge as documented above. Saves an Opus spawn on the common "Codex was just being strict" case. Does not apply to `question` or `recovery` modes — those don't involve Codex as a disagreeing party.

## Invocation

Lead spawns this skill with the `--mode` flag in the mission or context header:

```yaml
skill: leadv2-judge
mode: review     # OR: question | recovery
task_id: <id>
```

## Shared decision rubric

All three modes share this severity/confidence/escalation matrix:

### Severity scale (applies to all modes)

| Level | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `critical` | Violates `decisions:` or `off_limits`; blocks ship/continue |
| `high` | Functional bug, data-loss risk, security flaw; must address |
| `medium` | Non-functional defect, degraded but recoverable |
| `low` / noise | Style, log verbosity, cosmetic — never blocks verdict |

### Confidence thresholds

- `≥0.85` — state verdict plainly; no hedging.
- `0.60–0.84` — state verdict, append one caveat.
- `<0.60` — return `INSUFFICIENT_INFO` (review/question) or `ESCALATE_TO_FOUNDER` (recovery) with specific gap.

### Escalation matrix

| Condition | Verdict |
|---|---|
| Critical/high issue in scope + fixable | REVISE / RETRY_ALT_APPROACH |
| Critical/high issue + requires re-plan | ABORT / ESCALATE_TO_FOUNDER |
| No critical/high issues | APPROVE / GO / RETRY_SAME |
| Evidence insufficient | INSUFFICIENT_INFO / ESCALATE (state exact gap) |

## Mode-specific schemas and reads

For detailed input/output schemas per mode and allowed reads, see [MODES.md](./MODES.md). Fire that file when implementing or debugging a specific mode (review/question/recovery).

## Universal anti-patterns (all modes)

- Multi-turn deliberation. **ONE turn.**
- Reading raw code to "verify yourself". Trust reviewer claims / deliverable summaries.
- Hedging. Pick ONE verdict.
- Including noise/style issues as `blocking_issues`. Critical/high only.
- Spawning sub-subagents or calling MCP graph.
- RETRY_SAME after 2 failures (recovery mode). That's a loop.
- ESCALATE without a specific founder question (recovery mode).

## Legacy skills (removed)

`leadv2-judge-review` and `leadv2-judge-recovery` were deprecated 2026-05-04
(PO-063) and deleted 2026-07-03 once all callers were migrated. `leadv2-judge-question`
never existed as a separate skill (dangling reference, fixed same date).
All callers now use this skill with the appropriate `mode` flag.

To migrate a caller:
1. Replace `Skill(leadv2-judge-<X>)` with `Skill(leadv2-judge)` + `mode: <X>` in mission context.
2. Output format is identical — field names unchanged.
3. Remove the legacy invocation line once verified.
