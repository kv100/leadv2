# Workflow review fan-out — reference JS shape (leadv2-review §2)

Referenced from `leadv2-review/SKILL.md` §2. This is the REFERENCE SHAPE only — the canonical,
maintained script is `plugins/leadv2/scripts/leadv2-review-run.sh` (ONE-PATH-EVERYWHERE-01;
`workflows/leadv2-review.js` is deleted). Do NOT hand-inline a fresh script from this file; it
exists purely so the shape of the fan-out is legible without opening the engine script.

```js
// Workflow script — review fan-out
const DIFF_PATH = `/tmp/leadv2-review-<id>.diff`;

const round1 = await parallel([
  agent("critic", {
    model: safetyTouched ? "claude-opus-5" : "claude-sonnet-5",

The Workflow returns structured JSON findings directly — no Monitor polling, no manual deliverable-file
reads. Write the JSON results to `docs/handoff/<id>/reviews/round1-findings.json` and proceed to §3 using
the structured output (no `cx-tail.sh` needed). Codex review (`codex-task.sh adversarial-review`) stays
orthogonal: fire it as an optional background Bash call outside the Workflow if available.
