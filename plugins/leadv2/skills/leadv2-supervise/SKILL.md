# Lead v2 Supervise Mode (D-f = variant A)

## When: founder wants to run several tasks in parallel and just be pinged for
what needs him. When NOT: single-task interactive work (use `/leadv2` normally
— supervise is a dispatcher+overseer, not a worker itself).

## Target scenario

"I open `/leadv2 supervise`, it reconciles what's already running, I pick a
few more tasks from a list — it dispatches them and just watches, forwarding
me messages." This is a distinct supervisor session, not a single-task lead.
It owns no task, phase, worktree, task lock, or child prompt history. Each
child is an independent full lead session; only the shared control plane
(registry, quota, questions, completion receipts) crosses that boundary.
Only things that need the founder reach chat.

## Flow (5 steps, in order)

1. **Reconcile + adopt existing work, then render the resume block.** Call
   `scripts/leadv2-supervise.sh --json` (a full, non-delta call). This single
   call already does everything needed: renders the live table AND runs the
   D-d tmux reconciliation —
   triple-proof adoption of orphan tmux windows (window name matches a known
   task id AND a live `claude` PID descends from the pane), corroborated
   (twice-polled) death detection with tombstone-before-prune, and the F2
   truth-probe hook. Read the JSON's `orphans` / `adopted` / `would_adopt` /
   `would_prune` / `dead` keys — an eligible adoption or prune that was
   suppressed by `observe_only` (env override, or the automatic first-2-cycle
   D-e rollout window) is still ALWAYS present in `would_adopt`/`would_prune`,
   never silently dropped. Report those to the founder as "seen but not
   applied yet", not as absent.

   **SESSION-HANDOFF-01 — render the resume block BEFORE the picker.** The
   same `--json` payload carries a `resume` key: a bounded (~60-80 line,
   <=6KB) `<supervisor-handoff>` block live-composed from canonical on-disk
   sources — role + founder standing rules (open-threads.md head, verbatim,
   sacrosanct/never truncated), live lanes reconciled from `active.yaml`
   (id/phase/pid/provider/blocker), one focus + next-action line, the
   freshest open-threads.md tail entries, and `tasks.yaml` P0/P1 top-10. Print
   `resume.block` to the founder VERBATIM as your first output this session
   — before step 2's picker, before any dispatch. This is restore, not
   narration: do not re-summarize it in your own words. Two degraded cases,
   never silently skip either:
   - `resume.status == "skipped_delta"` should never occur on this mandatory
     first (non-delta) call — if it does, something upstream forced delta
     mode; treat as `degraded` and fall back to `--print` below.
   - `resume.status == "degraded"` (missing/malformed source, composer
     timeout/crash) — print the block's own "HANDOFF DEGRADED" section and
     its pointers line as-is; never fabricate the missing continuity.

   **Fallback entry point.** If the mandatory `--json` call itself fails, or
   its `resume` key is entirely absent (stale plugin copy), run
   `scripts/leadv2-supervise.sh --print` directly — this execs straight into
   the same composer (`leadv2-supervise-resume.sh`), skipping every
   reconciliation/mutation path (sentinel write, tmux adopt/prune,
   phase-backfill, truth-probe), and renders the identical bounded block.
   Never invent a substitute summary when both paths degrade — surface the
   degraded block and its pointers to the founder honestly.

   This step is `--print`/`resume`-only: it never touches the compact-path
   freeze/reground files, and it drops the DUE scheduled-decisions ledger
   entirely (already injected once at `SessionStart` by
   `scheduled-decisions-inject.sh` — this would be a duplicate).
2. **Pick <=5.** Call `scripts/leadv2-supervise-pick.sh [N<=10]` — a
   read-only ranked picker over `docs/tasks.yaml` top candidates plus any
   cached truth-probe breach (a RED breach's linked work item is pre-ranked
   first with `recommend:true`). It NEVER dispatches anything itself.
   **The AskUserQuestion MUST open with the plan-vs-backlog fork (founder
   feedback 2026-07-29):** option 1 = «продолжить CURRENT-PLAN» naming the
   plan's in-flight cluster (session-transfer resume — never silent), the
   rest = the ranked backlog list (multiSelect); founder picks 0-5. The same
   message echoes the lane cap from `active-limits.yaml` («cap N, автодобор
   on/off») so one word corrects it.
   Zero selection is valid — it means "just watch what's already adopted".
3. **Dispatch picked tasks through the classification funnel.** Call
   `scripts/leadv2-fanout.sh --tasks <comma-separated-ids> --provider auto
   --headless`. With `LEADV2_FANOUT_CLASS_FUNNEL=1` (default), class
   Trivial/Light/Standard routes to the single-worker funnel
   (`leadv2-dispatch-code.sh`: opus architect-prepass → one worker → e2e
   gate → cross-review) and only Heavy/Strategic gets a full Phase-0..8
   child session with its own worktree claim. Passing an explicit
   `--provider`/`--lead-model` other than auto REJECTS the funnel and forces
   the full-cycle path (which honors the override) — overrides are never
   silently dropped. `=0` restores the old always-full-cycle behavior. `leadv2-session-route.sh` deterministically
   chooses the provider/model: routine Light/Standard work may use Codex when
   its CLI, leadv2 skill, and quota headroom are available; Heavy/Strategic or
   high-risk tags stay on Claude/Opus. The provider-neutral runner passes
   `/leadv2 <task-id>` (or the Codex skill-equivalent) and resumes the SAME
   Claude session/Codex thread until the common
   canonical `docs/handoff/<task-id>/phase8-passed.flag` or its validated
   shared control-plane completion receipt exists. A clean model
   turn without that sentinel is INCOMPLETE, never complete. Child-internal
   Workflow/Agent calls remain valid phase helpers, but they are not
   top-level supervised task lanes. Every launch and resume writes auditable
   `provider_receipts` to `active.yaml`.
4. **Attach the loop.** `scripts/leadv2-supervise-loop.sh --ensure` via
   `Monitor` — idempotent PID+birth-sentinel attach, never a duplicate loop on
   re-entry/PostCompact. The LOOP renders output, not the lead: URGENT events
   (new question / dead / close / truth-breach) surface within ~5s; a full
   pulse of exactly N <=180-byte lines (one per non-dead lane) every 300s.
   **TOKEN-ECONOMY-01 (2026-07-27): attach with a filtering `Monitor(command=)`,
   never a raw `Monitor(path=<log>)`.** Every stdout line from a Monitor'd
   process/command is a model-visible wake, regardless of whether it needs a
   decision — this is fixed harness behaviour the plugin cannot change. The
   loop already tags every decision-worthy line with the literal substring
   `URGENT` (question/dead/stuck/closed/truth-breach — see `_render_events`
   and the `TRUTH_RED` branch of `_render_pulse` in
   `scripts/leadv2-supervise-loop.sh`); routine pulse rows, `DONE`, and
   `started`/`already running` lines never contain it. Attach with:
   ```
   Monitor(command="tail -F -n0 '<supervise-loop.log path>' | grep --line-buffered URGENT")
   ```
   `-n0` skips backlog on attach (no wake for history); `grep --line-buffered`
   only emits (and only wakes the lead) on a URGENT-tagged line, so it still
   surfaces within the same ~5s the loop appends it. No-decision events never
   reach stdout, so they never cost a turn. Do not `Monitor(path=<log>)`
   directly — that mode has no filter and wakes on every appended line
   (pulse rows, DONE, started/already-running), which is the dominant
   supervisor-turn cost this rule exists to kill.
5. **Founder contract.**
   - Questions surface INSTANTLY as `AskUserQuestion` — never batched into
     the next pulse.
   - All other status is relayed VERBATIM from loop lines. **Zero narration**
     between polls — no "запустил", "читаю", "синтезирую".
   - The 30-minute broad status is a `[BROAD_STATUS] ... [BROAD_STATUS_END]`
     block the loop already writes to `supervise-loop.log` (see
     `docs/supervisor-role.md` §Status reporting standard for the exact
     table shape). Paste that block VERBATIM as one chat turn when it
     appears — the lead never hand-composes a status, never re-tables the
     lane rows, and never spins up a `CronCreate` job to produce one; the
     cadence is a plugin-owned loop beat (`leadv2-supervise-loop.sh`,
     `LEADV2_SUPERVISE_BROAD_STATUS_S`), not something the lead schedules.
   - A corroborated-dead lane is **NEVER auto-restarted.** It is tombstoned
     (already done by step 1's reconciliation) and escalated to the founder
     via `scripts/leadv2-ask.sh` with exactly three options: `inspect` (logs
     first), `restart`, `abandon`. Only an explicit `restart` answer may
     dispatch again.

## Direct fanout — full-cycle dispatch without the supervisor UI

`/leadv2 fanout [--n N] [--provider auto|claude|codex]
[--backend tmux|headless]` uses the same provider router and full Phase 0..8
runner, but exits after dispatch: no picker, reconciliation, or watch loop.
`/leadv2 supervise` is fanout plus the interactive selection and monitoring
control plane. Existing tmux/headless children remain observed and adopted by
the same `leadv2-supervise.sh` / `leadv2-supervise-loop.sh` machinery.

## Async question channel — canonical scripts, two stores by design

Both scripts below are REAL, canonical, and live in this plugin's
`scripts/` — not aspirational or persona-engine-only prototypes:

- **Cross-worktree (canonical for fanned-out/adopted lanes):**
  `scripts/leadv2-ask.sh <task-id> "<question>" --option "label|desc" [...]
  [--timeout <sec=1800>]` — writes `<control-plane>/questions/<qid>.yaml`
  (resolved via `leadv2-state-path.sh`, OUTSIDE any worktree — reachable from
  every session of this repo, which is exactly what a fanned-out session in
  its own `git worktree add` checkout needs) and blocks until answered.
  Answered via `scripts/leadv2-answer.sh <q-id> <option-label>` — wired to
  `/leadv2 reply <q-id> <option>` and `/leadv2 questions`.
- **Same-session embedded subagents (only for child-internal phase helpers):**
  `leadv2_ask_async` / `leadv2_wait_answer` (in `leadv2-helpers.sh`) write
  `docs/handoff/<task_id>/questions-async/<qid>-pending.yaml` — worktree-local,
  fine for an embedded subagent in the SAME session/worktree as the lead.
  Answered via `scripts/leadv2-reply.sh --task-id <id> <qid> <option>`.

`/leadv2 reply <q-id> <option>` itself never picks between the two scripts by
hand (LANE-QUESTION-DELIVERY-01) — it calls `scripts/leadv2-reply-router.sh
<q-id> <option>`, which checks the control-plane store first and falls back
to a `docs/handoff/*/questions-async/<qid>-pending.yaml` glob, then execs the
matching one of the two scripts above. A qid found in neither store, or in
both (id collision), fails loudly naming what was checked — never a silent
no-op.

`leadv2-supervise.sh` dual-reads both stores (it never writes to either
except via the same reply calls a founder-driven `/leadv2 reply` would make)
so the supervising lead sees pending questions regardless of which store a
given lane's protocol version uses. Do not add a third store.

## Snapshot / loop / pick script contracts

- `scripts/leadv2-supervise.sh [--json] [--since <ISO>] [--print]` — the core
  reconciliation snapshot.
  - No `--since`: full call — compact table + `orphans`/`adopted`/
    `would_adopt`/`would_prune`/`dead` (D-d) + `truth_probe`/`truth_breaches`
    (F2, only computed on full calls) + `requires_founder`/`stuck`/
    `closed_since_last` + `resume` (SESSION-HANDOFF-01, full calls only — a
    bounded `<supervisor-handoff>` restore block; `"skipped_delta"`/
    `"degraded"` status never fabricates continuity).
  - `--print`: bypasses reconciliation/mutation entirely and execs into
    `scripts/leadv2-supervise-resume.sh`, printing the same bounded resume
    block (text by default, `--json` for the structured object) — the
    lightweight fallback entry point when the mandatory first call is
    unavailable.
  - `--since <ISO>`: delta mode — only events not already reported in the
    previous snapshot; silence if nothing changed. Death corroboration still
    advances on delta calls (a candidate needs two CONSECUTIVE calls, delta
    or full, to be corroborated) but the tmux/truth-probe reconciliation
    itself only runs on full calls.
  - Read-only w.r.t. everything except D-d's own adopt/tombstone/prune writes
    (gated by `observe_only`); `set -euo pipefail`; a broken `active.yaml`
    prints a `WARN:` and continues rather than crashing the loop.
- `scripts/leadv2-supervise-loop.sh [--ensure]` — Monitor-attachable
  two-cadence loop (5s event poll / 300s pulse). The loop owns the sleep —
  never the LLM. `--ensure` attaches to a live loop instead of duplicating.
- `scripts/leadv2-supervise-pick.sh [N<=10]` — read-only ranked picker over
  `docs/tasks.yaml` + cached truth breaches. Never dispatches.

## Entry points

- `/leadv2 supervise` — reconcile+adopt -> pick <=5 -> provider-aware full
  `/leadv2` child sessions -> attach loop.
- `/leadv2 fanout [--n N] [--provider auto|claude|codex]
  [--backend tmux|headless]` — the same full-cycle dispatch, without the
  interactive supervisor loop.
