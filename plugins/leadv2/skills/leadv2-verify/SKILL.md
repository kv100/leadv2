# Lead v2 Verify — Live Signal Gate

## When: Phase 7, after Deploy clean. When NOT: deploy circuit-broke.

## VERIFY PASS requires (anti-lying-green invariants — full text: `ref/anti-lying-green-gates.md`)

Before declaring verify complete, ALL 4 must hold: (1) a concrete live signal (real DB row w/ id, non-zero metric delta, timestamped log line, or confirmed HTTP response — "no error" alone is NOT a pass); (2) probe exit code captured non-masked (never swallowed by `|| true`/`2>/dev/null`); (3) 0/null/empty result → mandatory layer-by-layer re-probe (alternate key, RUN_MODE=prod, event-emitted check) before treating it as a real negative — never close on 0/null without this; (4) `verify-probe-result.yaml` written with `outcome: probe_ok` (no other value admits close).

## Protocol

### 1. Read verification spec from context.yaml

```yaml
verification:
  live_signal: "one-sentence description for history"
  probe:
    type: signal-file | log-grep | http-check | supabase-check
    args: ...
  timeout: 1800   # seconds, default 30 min
```

If `verification.probe` missing → circuit break: "verification spec missing, architect should have defined".

### 1b. Evaluate typed criteria (pre-probe gate — optional)

If `verification.criteria[]` is present in context.yaml, evaluate each item IN ORDER before running the probe.
When `criteria[]` is present, evaluate it first; when absent, proceed directly to the probe step — behavior is byte-identical to the existing path.

**programmatic** (`type: programmatic`):
Run the `check` argv as a subprocess.
- `expect: exit_zero` → pass if exit code is 0; fail otherwise.
- `expect: exit_nonzero` → pass if exit code is non-zero; fail otherwise.
- `expect: stdout_contains` → pass if stdout includes the `contains` substring; fail otherwise.
Never swallow the exit code with `|| true` or `2>/dev/null` on the assertion step.

**judge** (`type: judge`):
Present the `rubric` string to the LLM/founder for a structured verdict.
Accepted responses: `pass` or `revise`. Any other response → treat as `revise`.
On `revise` → stop, emit the rubric + LLM/founder response to the deliverable, return PROBE_NEG.

**human** (`type: human`):
Show the `prompt` string to founder and wait for explicit confirmation.
Use `ask-lead.sh` with the prompt text. Accept only an explicit `yes/pass/ok` as confirmation; any other response → treat as not-confirmed → PROBE_NEG.

**Failure mode:** if ANY criterion fails → write `verify-probe-result.yaml` with `outcome: probe_neg` and the failing criterion id+reason. Do NOT proceed to the probe step. Return PROBE_NEG.

**Success mode:** all criteria pass → proceed to probe step below (live_signal/probe path) as normal.

### 1c. Long log reads → fork, not inline and not Explore (WHEN-TO-FORK-01)

A verification step that means reading a LONG log/journal (journalctl walk, multi-file
probe triage, "what actually happened in this deploy") **and** whose interpretation depends
on this session's context (what was just deployed, which decision was made here) →
spawn `Agent(subagent_type=fork)`. The fork inherits the full conversation (no re-briefing),
runs in the background, and its tool output stays out of the lead's context — only the
verdict returns. A read that needs NO session context (pure fact from disk) → `Explore`/haiku
as usual. Note: forks always run on the lead's model (Opus); `model=` is ignored.
Full fork-vs-lane-vs-agent table: `docs/work-placement.md`.

### 2. Choose probe mode

**Decision flowchart:**

```
task-class = Light AND no runtime path touched?
  └─ YES → single-probe OK (any existing type)
  └─ NO  → corroborate required (positive + ≥1 no-regression probe)
```

Heavy tasks (any change to agent cycle, publish path, scheduler, VPS runtime): REQUIRE `--corroborate`.
Light tasks (docs, web UI, schema-only, non-runtime platform code): single-probe acceptable.

### Corroboration mode (default for Heavy tasks)

Write a YAML config file, then invoke:
```bash
verify-probe.sh --timeout 180 --corroborate /tmp/verify-<task-id>.yaml
```

For the full corroborate config schema (positive/no_regression fields, thresholds), see [SCHEMAS.md](./SCHEMAS.md).

Behaviour: positive probe runs first (60s timeout). If it fails → PROBE_NEG, stop.
If it passes, each no-regression probe runs in sequence (60s each, 180s total budget).
If ANY no-regression probe fails → PROBE_NEG (regression likely). All must pass → PROBE_OK.

All sub-probes emit structured JSON to stderr: `{"probe":"<type>","result":"pass|fail","reason":"..."}`.

### Launch probe — single-probe (Light tasks or backward compat)

Always pass `--result-file` so `verify-probe-result.yaml` is written atomically
(PO-058 contract: `docs/specs/leadv2-verify-contract.md`).

Compose probe command based on type:

| Type | Command |
|---|---|
| signal-file | `verify-probe.sh --timeout <N> --signal-file <path> --result-file docs/handoff/<id>/verify-probe-result.yaml` |
| log-grep | `verify-probe.sh --timeout <N> --log-grep <vps> <file> "<pattern>" --result-file docs/handoff/<id>/verify-probe-result.yaml` |
| http-check | `verify-probe.sh --timeout <N> --http-check <url> --result-file docs/handoff/<id>/verify-probe-result.yaml` |
| supabase-check | `verify-probe.sh --timeout <N> --supabase-check "<description>" --result-file docs/handoff/<id>/verify-probe-result.yaml` |

For **log-grep on VPS**, wrap via ssh (both VPS in parallel or whichever is relevant):
```bash
ssh <host> "tail -F <your-app-log-path>" | verify-probe.sh --log-grep /dev/stdin "<pattern>" --timeout <N> \
  --result-file "docs/handoff/<id>/verify-probe-result.yaml" &
```

Run in background, capture PID.

### 3. Wait — use Monitor

```
Monitor:
  command: while ! ls /tmp/verify-<task-id>.done 2>/dev/null; do
    <probe writes /tmp/verify-<task-id>.done on exit with status inside>
    sleep 10
  done
  echo "probe finished: $(cat /tmp/verify-<task-id>.done)"
  description: "live verify for <task-id>"
  timeout_ms: <probe-timeout * 1000 + 60000>
```

### 4. Interpret result (PO-058)

Read `outcome:` from `verify-probe-result.yaml` — do NOT rely solely on exit code:

```bash
source "$(bash .claude/scripts/lv2 --path leadv2-helpers.sh)"
PROBE_RESULT="docs/handoff/${TASK_ID}/verify-probe-result.yaml"
_validate_probe_result "$PROBE_RESULT" || echo "[verify] WARN: probe result schema invalid"
outcome=$(python3 -c "import yaml; print(yaml.safe_load(open('$PROBE_RESULT'))['outcome'])" 2>/dev/null)
```

| `outcome` field | Exit | Meaning | Action |
|---|---|---|---|
| `probe_ok` | 0 | signal seen | Phase 8 Close |
| `probe_timeout` | 1 | never saw signal | Trigger `leadv2-recovery` with reason: timeout |
| `probe_negative` | 2 | negative signal (error line in log) | Immediate `leadv2-rollback.sh` + `leadv2-recovery` |

### 5. Project override hook

Before selecting probe type, check for a project-level verify override:

```bash
OVERRIDE="$CLAUDE_PROJECT_ROOT/.claude/leadv2-overrides/verify.sh"
STACK="$CLAUDE_PROJECT_ROOT/.claude/leadv2-overrides/stack.yaml"

if [[ -f "$OVERRIDE" ]]; then
  # Run project-specific verify script
  LEAD_V2_TASK_ID="<task-id>" \
  LEAD_V2_DEPLOY_TARGET="<target-if-known>" \
    bash "$OVERRIDE"
  override_rc=$?
  case $override_rc in
    0) echo "[verify] override PASS — proceed to Phase 8 Close" ;;
    1) echo "[verify] override TIMEOUT — trigger leadv2-recovery reason:timeout" ;;
    2) echo "[verify] override NEGATIVE SIGNAL — trigger leadv2-rollback + leadv2-recovery" ;;
  esac
  # Map exit code to probe outcome and skip generic probe steps below
  # Record in verify-probe-result.yaml and proceed per §4 table
else
  echo "[verify] no project override — using generic probe (§2 flowchart)"
fi
```

If no override exists: escalate via `leadv2-founder-input` with message:
"project has no verify.sh override in .claude/leadv2-overrides/ — define probe spec"

### 5b. Verify-probe types — generic (used when no override)

For probe templates by change type (publish-cycle log-grep, web/dashboard http-check, schema/migration supabase-check, cron/scheduler log-grep), see [EXAMPLES.md](./EXAMPLES.md).

### 6. State update on success

```
LEAD_V2_STATE.md:
  phase: verify
  step: confirmed
  note: "live signal: <description>, seen at <timestamp>"

context.yaml.verification.confirmed_at: <ISO>
```

```bash
source "$(bash .claude/scripts/lv2 --path leadv2-helpers.sh)" && leadv2_active_update_phase close
```

#### 6a. [R3-3 MANDATORY] Write pending-close.yaml (close obligation, survives /compact)

Immediately after `probe_ok`, before proceeding to Phase 8:

```bash
# [R3-3 COMPACT-SURVIVE-03] Durable close obligation — SessionStart reads this and reminds
# the lead to run phase8-close if the session was compacted between verify and close.
_PENDING_CLOSE_DIR="${CLAUDE_PROJECT_ROOT:-$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)}/docs/leadv2/tasks/${LEADV2_TASK_ID}"
mkdir -p "$_PENDING_CLOSE_DIR"
python3 -c "
import yaml, sys, datetime, pathlib
p = pathlib.Path(sys.argv[1])
d = {
    'task_id': sys.argv[2],
    'owed_phase': 'phase8-close',
    'phase8_context': {
        'verdict': 'PASS',
        'deploy_sha': sys.argv[3],
        'created_at': datetime.datetime.utcnow().strftime('%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ'),
    }
}
p.write_text(yaml.dump(d, default_flow_style=False, allow_unicode=True))
" "${_PENDING_CLOSE_DIR}/pending-close.yaml" \
  "${LEADV2_TASK_ID}" \
  "$(git rev-parse --short HEAD 2>/dev/null || echo no-deploy)"
```

Phase 8 close automatically deletes `pending-close.yaml`; if the session is compacted before
phase8-close runs, the SessionStart hook injects a reminder so the obligation is not dropped.

Proceed to Phase 8 Close.

### 7. State update on failure

```
LEAD_V2_STATE.md:
  phase: verify
  step: failed
  status: recovery
  note: "probe <timeout|negative>, triggering recovery"
```

Invoke `leadv2-recovery` skill.

## Browser-qa step (frontend changes only)

**Configurable frontend roots:** by default `web/`. Repos with a different layout list path prefixes in `.claude/leadv2-overrides/frontend-paths.txt` (one prefix per line). E.g. m3-market: `m3/apps/`. The trigger reads that file if present, else defaults to `["web/"]`.

**RUN ONLY IF** at least one of:
- `git diff --name-only HEAD~1 HEAD` contains a path matching any configured frontend root
- `context.yaml.affected_paths` contains an entry matching any configured frontend root

Other tasks bypass this step automatically — no delay, no output file.

When triggered, run the frontend smoke-check sequence (load frontend roots config, find preview URL, HTTP smoke check, optional Playwright check, write `verify-browser.md`) — full steps and bash: [BROWSER-QA.md](./BROWSER-QA.md).

A `http_warn` or `playwright_warn` result is **advisory** — Phase 8 Close proceeds regardless, unless the main positive probe also failed. Log the warning in `LEAD_V2_STATE.md` and continue.

A `http_ok` or `playwright_ok` result counts as an **additional corroboration** probe — record in `context.yaml.verification.browser_qa`.

## Rules

- **No "tests pass" shortcut.** Tests ≠ live signal. Must see real production effect.
- **Timeout must be realistic.** Publish cycle = 30-60 min. HTTP = seconds. Don't set 5-min for cron task.
- **Supabase-check is last resort.** Prefer log-grep or http-check. Manual prompt defeats autonomy.
- **Negative signal > timeout.** Error in log → immediate rollback, don't wait for timeout.
- **Heavy task = corroborate required.** When runtime paths are touched, corroboration is required — a green log line with a concurrent 5xx spike is a false green. Use `--corroborate` with ≥1 no-regression probe.
- **Light task = single-probe acceptable.** Docs, web UI, schema-only changes don't need no-regression probes.

## Anti-patterns

- Asking founder "выглядит норм?" instead of defining a probe — that's abdicating automation.
- Probe returns OK but log has errors → missed scope of probe. Fix probe def, not skip.
- Accepting "systemd active" as verify — systemd only confirms process started, not did its work.
