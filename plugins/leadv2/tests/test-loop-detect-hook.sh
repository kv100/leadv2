# tests/test-loop-detect-hook.sh — regression test for leadv2-loop-detect-hook.sh
# (fix-round-2, task 6d0c93f4a7b2, items 2 and 6).
#
# (a) F4 regression: pipes synthetic PreToolUse+PostToolUse payloads through the
#     wrapper N times and asserts /tmp/leadv2-loop-detect-<key>.json is created
#     and tool_counts increments. The original defect (D6/F4) was `python3 -c
#     "..." -- a b c` shifting sys.argv, silently resolving detect_script to the
#     wrong string, so the detector never ran and no state file was ever
#     written -- this test FAILS LOUDLY against that wrapper (no state file
#     appears) and must keep failing if `--` is ever reintroduced.
# (b) item 6 (BLOCKING): a call denied at the tool-cap limit must NOT increment
#     the persisted counter -- only a call that actually executes (PostToolUse)
#     may increment it.
# (c) item 6 (BLOCKING): a child agent (distinct agent_id, same session_id) gets
#     its own counter namespace and is not blocked by the parent's count.
#
# Usage: bash tests/test-loop-detect-hook.sh
# Exit 0 = all pass; non-zero = failure count.
# run-all-triggers: leadv2-loop-detect-hook
#
# SUITE-SELECTION-COVERS-140-OF-390-01: this suite carried no trigger
# marker and matched no name convention, so `run-all.sh --scope changed`
# never selected it — it could only ever run under `--scope all`. The
# triggers are the production files the suite's own body references most,
# with shared helpers excluded so a helper edit does not select everything.
